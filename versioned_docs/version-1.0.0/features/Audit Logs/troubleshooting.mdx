There are **several reasons** why you might be **unable to see logs** in the audit log page.

### Reason 1: Environment

The audit logs are displayed for the selected **active environment**, so make sure that the relevant environment is selected for which you want to see logs.

Change environments in the **[Project Management](https://app.permit.io/project-management)** page by simply clicking on the relevant **Set as active environment** button.

### Reason 2: Your App is not connected

Make sure you have successfully connected Permit SDK or the API to your app.

- Navigate to **[Connecting Your App](/1.0.0/tutorials/Onboarding/connect-your-app)** in the Onboarding section for help.
- Navigate to **[connect an SDK](https://app.permit.io/get-started/connect-an-sdk)** page for written instructions.
- You can open `http://localhost:4000/` which is your final step in the onboarding guide, to make sure that your test app is running.

### Reason 3: PDP container isn't running

One of the reasons that logs will not appear in the audit log screen is that the PDP container is not running in the background.

If this is the case, you will see that your **user is not permitted to perform actions** regardless of the user's roles and permissions.

To fix this issue, follow the instructions on how to run Permit available on the **[connect an SDK](https://app.permit.io/get-started/connect-an-sdk)** page.

### Reason 4: Filters prevents logs from appearing

If you applied a filter on the audit log page, your audits might not appear.

To remove the filters, simply **refresh** the audit log page.
