## What is Permit.io?

Permit.io is a fullstack authorization solution enabling developers to bake-in access-control into their products
within minutes and have them ready for future demands from customers and regulations.

Our developer SDK integrates with your app and enables you to add declarative permission
checks that are as easy to use as feature flags.

Our solution is built upon strong open source foundations, enables Git-Ops out of the box,
and goes far beyond enforcement - providing seamless access control **experiences** meant
for humans that simply work "**out-of-the-box**".
