# What is OPToggles?
We often want our frontend to reflect the permissions enforced by the backend. E.g. if a user is not allowed to click run the action behind a button - don't show them that button. 

`OPToggles` brings the power of <a href="https://github.com/permitio/opal" target="_blank">`OPA` + `OPAL`</a> into your existing feature toggling solutions. <br/>
It enables you to create user targeted feature flags/toggles based on <a href="https://openpolicyagent.org" target="_blank">Open Policy</a> managed authorization rules, and keep them
synced thanks to `OPAL`'s realtime policy and policy-data change detection.<br/>
<br/>
With OPToggles frontend devs can continue to enjoy working with the feature flags they are familar with, and backend-devs easily harness the power of open-policy.
