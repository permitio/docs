title: Permit and Descope Demo
---

Dive into our demonstration project where a Notion-clone's user-friendly interface meets the robust security of Descope and the
precision of Permit.io's authorization.

This integration exemplifies a harmonious blend of user experience, fortified authentication,
and meticulous access control. Experience a modern digital workspace where user-centric design and cutting-edge security go hand-in-hand.

## The Application

This documentation details our project that integrates a Notion-clone interface, designed as a collaborative workspace,
with the authentication capabilities of Descope and the detailed authorization features of Permit.io. This integration extends beyond a
mere combination of two technologies; it outlines a structured approach to ensuring both secure user identities and precise action governance.

Upon completing this walkthrough, readers will have a clear blueprint of integrating Descope's authentication system with Permit.io's
authorization controls, all within the context of a Notion-clone environment, achieving a balance of user experience and security.

## Setting Up Resources and Roles

For this Notion clone, we'll configure resources representing workspaces, files, and sharing capabilities. These resources have actions such as:

- create
- read
- update
- delete
- share

**Roles to be defined include**:

- workspaceAdmin
- fileOwner
- fileViewer
- fileEditor

Roles and resources can be created and managed via the Permit Dashboard, the Permit API, or SDKs like Python and NodeJS.
Additional SDKs are detailed in the documentation.

## Configuring Permissions

- workspaceAdmin has all permissions related to workspace management.
- fileOwner can create, read, update, delete, and share files.
- fileViewer only has read permission for files.
- fileEditor can read, update, and share files.

Permissions can be designated through the Permit Dashboard or the Permit API.

## Cloning the Application

```
git clone https://github.com/permitio/descope-integration
```

## Incorporate Descope and Permit Credentials

Place your Descope credentials and your Permit API key in the .env file.

```
DESCOPE_CLIENT_ID=<descope_client_id>
DESCOPE_CLIENT_SECRET=<descope_client_secret>
PERMIT_API_KEY=<permit_api_key>
```

## Authentication with Descope

Implement Descope SDK to manage user sign-up, login, and session management. After successful authentication with Descope,
use the token to sync user details with Permit.io for authorization.

## Authorization with Permit.io

Once users are authenticated, use the Permit.io SDK to verify their permissions based on their roles.
For instance, before a user can create a file, check if they have the create permission for files.

## Descope Authentication

With Descope SDK, direct users to the Descope login/signup page. Once logged in, redirect them back to the Notion clone, where their
authentication token will be used to manage their session and also sync with Permit.io for authorization.

## Synchronize Descope Users with Permit.io

After a successful Descope authentication, synchronize users' roles and permissions with Permit.io. This is crucial to ensure that the
user's actions within the Notion clone align with their designated permissions.

## Authorization in Action

For example, when a user tries to share a private file, check their permissions using the Permit.io SDK. If they possess the share
permission for files, allow the action. If not, present an error message.

## Conclusion

By integrating Descope with Permit.io, the Notion clone UI offers a robust combination of authentication and fine-grained authorization,
ensuring a secure and smooth user experience.
