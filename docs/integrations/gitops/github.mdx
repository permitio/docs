#### Hosted Git support

This guide is demonstrating GitOps on Github, but should work in a similar fashion to other Git repositories which can be configured with an SSH key.

The main actions are, adding a SSH deploy key with write access to your repository, and configuring Permit to use it with the SSH url of your repository.

[Add deploy key to GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_keys/)

[Add deploy key to Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-an-ssh-key/)

:::info Note
This deploy key should not use 2 factor authentication. This is so that the Permit server can read and write to your repository with this key.
:::


## GitHub Example 

### Configure your git repository

Please follow the below steps to make your Permit policy stored at your git repository.

### Create a repository

You need a repository with a default branch that exists on the remote ( with an initial commit ).
If you already have a repository you can skip to [next step](#give-permit-permissions-to-your-repository).

Create your repository at [GitHub](https://github.com/new):

#### Project/Env mapping to Repositories and Branches

By default the following mapping takes effect - each repository is mapped to a specific Permit project, and under it branches are created and mapped for each Permit environment under the Project.
Additional layout are supported, but not currently available via the API.

### Give Permit permissions to your repository

In order for us to be able to generate and push policies to your repository, you need to create an SSH key,
and add it as a "Deploy Key" with write access to your repo.

#### Generate an SSH key

You can use this command to generate a secured SSH key:

```
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -C "help@permit.io"
```

You will be prompted to enter a location for the private and public keys ( your private key will be securely stored on our end, no passphrase will be required )
_![SSH key generation](/img/integrations/gitops/generate-ssh-key.png)_

The private key is at the location you chose and the public key is at the same location with a ".pub" suffix.

#### Add the Deploy Key

1. To add a "Deploy Key", go to your repository &rarr; Settings &rarr; Deploy Keys and press on "Add deploy key" button.

2. Copy the public SSH key you've generated [previously](#generate-an-ssh-key) to your clipboard and paste it in the GitHub prompt.

   **It is required to toggle the "Allow write access"**

## Configure Permit to use your repository

### Make Permit use the repository

1. Login to [Permit.io](https://app.permit.io).

2. Navigate to your project. with the project selector at sidebar.

3. Navigate to [API Keys](https://app.permit.io/settings/api-keys) page.

4. Create a Project or Organization API Key. (you will need it for the 8th step)

5. Copy the SSH url from GitHub:
   _![Copy SSH url](/img/integrations/gitops/github-copy-ssh-url.png)_

6. Copy the SSH private key you've generated [previously](#generate-an-ssh-key) and replace new lines with "\n".
   You can do the new line replacement using the following command:

   ```shell
   awk -v ORS='\\n' '1' <private-key-file>
   ```

7. Paste your values into that json and store at in a file:

   ```json
   {
   	"url": "<your-ssh-url>",
   	"main_branch_name": "<your-default-branch>",
   	"credentials": {
   		"auth_type": "ssh",
   		"username": "git",
   		"private_key": "<your-private-key>"
   	},
   	"key": "<your-custom-id-string-without-spaces>"
   }
   ```

8. Get your project key / id from this URL

   ```shell
   curl -X GET "https://api.permit.io/v2/projects" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY from step 4}"
   ```

9. Replace the placeholder with your project id or key and execute a POST request to Permit with your json:

   ```shell
   curl -X POST "https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/<your-project-id-or-key>/repos" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY from step 4}" --data-binary @"path/to/your/json"
   ```

10. Please return to your GitHub repository. You will now observe new branches, each corresponding to a different environment in your project. These branches are named following the format `permit/generated/<env_id>`, where `<env_id>` is the unique identifier for each environment.

11. After validating your new policy branches, you need to activate the new repository in Permit,
    to do this, replace the below placeholders with your project id or key and execute a PUT request to Permit:
    `shell
curl -X PUT "https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/<your-project-id-or-key>/repos/<your-repo-id-or-key>/activate" -H "Authorization: <your-permit-api-key>"
`
12. To add custom policy code for each environment, ensure you have checked out the correct branch using permit/generated/<env_id>. Insert your policy code exclusively within the `custom` folder. This can be done by either editing the `custom/root.rego` file with your custom Rego code or by creating a new file and importing it in the `custom/root.rego` file. 
Please avoid editing policy code outside of this folder, as it could potentially be overridden by our code or break the Rego code.

Once modifications are made within an environment branch, push it to the remote GitHub repository(To the same environment branch not the main branch). Permit cloud will then detect these changes and relay them to the PDP that is associated with that environment for update.

As a result, your git repository now serves as the policy source for your PDPs.

13. Your git repository is now ready to be synced to your PDPs 🚀
