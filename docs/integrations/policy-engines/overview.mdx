title: Multiple Policy-Engine Support
---

Permit.io, unlike other permission services, supports multiple policy engines and languages.
This support is enabled via Permit's [policy-editor](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor) (which generates policy as code in multiple languages) and via [OPAL](https://github.com/permitio/opal) which can manage multiple agents.

## OPA and Rego

The first engine supported by Permit, a popular CNCF graduated project.

## Cedar-Agent and Cedar

Cedar is an open-source engine and language created by AWS.
[Cedar agent](https://github.com/permitio/cedar-agent) is an OSS project from Permit.io - which provides the ability to run Cedar as a standalone agent (Similar to how one would use OPA) which can then be powered by [OPAL](https://github.com/permitio/opal).
Cedar agent is the easiest way to deploy and run Cedar.
