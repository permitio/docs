CASL is a versatile, open-source JavaScript library widely used for managing Access Control Lists (ACLs)
and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in JavaScript applications. It allows developers to
enforce granular permissions within applications, ensuring that resources and actions are accessible
only to authorized users or roles across various technology stacks.

## Permit.io & CASL

Leveraging CASL and Permit.io together, developers can create a refined system where frontend feature
flags are controlled based on user permissions and roles. This synergy not only facilitates a secure and
tailored user experience but also empowers development teams to manage and roll out new features effectively
and safely across diverse user bases.

## Our frontend SDK

In our dedicated pursuit to enhance developer experience and streamline frontend feature management, we
crafted a specialized package at Permit.io, encapsulating the prowess of both Permit and CASL. The
**[permit-fe-sdk](https://github.com/permitio/permit-fe-sdk)** enables developers to integrate sophisticated
permission-based feature toggling seamlessly across various frontend frameworks.

## React/NextJS Implementation

In order to start using the `permit-fe-sdk`, below is a step-by-step guide on how to incorporate it into your
React or NextJS app.

### Installing the relevant packages

<Tabs groupId="install">
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```bash
npm install @casl/ability @casl/react permit-fe-sdk permitio
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @casl/ability @casl/react permit-fe-sdk permitio
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create an API route to handle the permissions checks

As part of the CASL component that we will be creating later in this guide, we will need to specify an API
route that we can call, which will perform bulk `permit.check()` operations for us, returning the result for
each.

Here is a basic implementation of such endpoint, which we have under `/api/something`. You can name the file
as you wish.

```js
import { Permit } from "permitio";

const permit = new Permit({
  token: "YOUR_PERMIT_API_KEY",
  pdp: "http://localhost:7766",
});

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    const { user: userId, action, resource } = req.query;

    if (!userId) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: "No User Id" });
    }

    if (!action || !resource) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing action or resource" });
    }

    const allowed = await permit.check(userId, action, resource);

    if (!allowed) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: "Not allowed" });
    }

    return res.json({ permitted: allowed });
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal Server Error" });
  }
}
```

Pay attention that we have imported the Permit library and we initialized the Permit object. You can follow
this [guide](/getting-started/quickstart#get-your-permitio-environment-api-key) to understand where to fetch your API key from.

Once we are done with this step, we need to make sure pull and launch our PDP - you can also find the steps on
how to do this [here](/getting-started/quickstart#setup-your-pdp-policy-decision-point-container).

### Creating the `AbilityLoader`

The AbilityLoader component is integral to this setup, diligently working to asynchronously retrieve and
establish user-specific permissions, particularly upon user sign-in.

In this scenario, we're employing Clerk.com as our authentication provider to obtain the userId, which we have
synchronized with Permit. This allows us to identify the currently logged-in user and correlate them with the
associated policy for their role. It's crucial to highlight that you can choose any authentication provider
that best fits your needs—Permit is designed to integrate seamlessly with all of them.

```js
import React, { createContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { Ability } from "@casl/ability";
import { Permit, permitState } from "permit-fe-sdk";

// Create Context
export const AbilityContext = createContext();

export const AbilityLoader = ({ children }) => {
  const { isSignedIn, user } = useUser();
  const [ability, setAbility] = useState(undefined);

  useEffect(() => {
    const getAbility = async (loggedInUser) => {
      const permit = Permit({
        loggedInUser: loggedInUser,
        backendUrl: "/api/something",
      });

      await permit.loadLocalState([
        { action: "view", resource: "Products" },
        { action: "view", resource: "document" },
        { action: "view", resource: "file" },
        { action: "view", resource: "component" },
      ]);

      const caslConfig = permitState.getCaslJson();

      return caslConfig && caslConfig.length ? new Ability(caslConfig) : undefined;
    };

    if (isSignedIn) {
      getAbility(user.id).then((caslAbility) => {
        setAbility(caslAbility);
      });
    }
  }, [isSignedIn, user]);

  return <AbilityContext.Provider value={ability}>{children}</AbilityContext.Provider>;
};
```

:::note
In this guide, we do not cover how you should sync your user into Permit, nor how to setup your policy.
:::

Let's break the above code down into smaller chunks so we know exactly what is happening.

#### Creating a Context

The `AbilityContext` is crafted to share the user's permissions (or "abilities"), which are managed and
determined by CASL, across different components.

When AbilityContext is employed, it allows the permissions (or "abilities") data to be accessible and
utilized by any component that consumes this context, without the need to prop-drill the data through
numerous component layers.

```js
// Create Context
export const AbilityContext = createContext();
```

#### Getting abilities

This step uses the `id` of the presently logged-in user from the session, transmitting a request to the
previously defined API endpoint, and subsequently loading each of the **actions** and **resources** into the
local state.

It executes permit checks against the established policy to ascertain whether the current user is
authorized to execute the specified actions on the defined resources. Subsequently, the outcome is stored
in `permitState`, from which the results of the permission checks are returned.

```js
const getAbility = async (loggedInUser) => {
  const permit = Permit({
    loggedInUser: loggedInUser,
    backendUrl: "/api/dashboard",
  });

  await permit.loadLocalState([
    { action: "view", resource: "Products" },
    { action: "view", resource: "Product_Configurators" },
    { action: "view", resource: "Project_Builder" },
    { action: "view", resource: "Topics_for_you" },
  ]);

  const caslConfig = permitState.getCaslJson();

  return caslConfig && caslConfig.length ? new Ability(caslConfig) : undefined;
};
```

#### Returning the `AbilityContext.Provider`

The last step in the `AbilityLoader` is to enable this component to be a wrapper for the whole app, so that the
abilities are globally accessible.

```js
<AbilityContext.Provider value={ability}>{children}</AbilityContext.Provider>
```

### Wrapping our App with the `AbilityLoader`

Once we are ready to utilize the abilities to render parts of the UI based on the users permissions,
we need to wrap our whole application in the `<AbilityLoader>` component, getting access to the `permitState`
globally.

```js
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { AbilityLoader } from "../utils/AbilityLoader";
import "../styles/global.css";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
      <AbilityLoader>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </AbilityLoader>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

### Conditionally rendering components with `permitState`

First of all, in the file where you want to render part of the UI based on a condition, make sure you import
`permitState`.

```js
import { permitState } from "permit-fe-sdk";
```

Then, utilize permitState to render parts of the HTML.

```js
<div>
  {permitState?.check("view", "document") && (
    <div className="bg-white m-4 p-4 h-full">Document</div>
  )}
</div>
```
