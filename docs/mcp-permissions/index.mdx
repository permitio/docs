# MCP Permissions

MCPermit is a comprehensive permissions layer designed specifically for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It enables organizations to implement fine-grained access control for their AI agents while maintaining security and compliance requirements.

## Core Concepts

MCPermit combines several powerful technologies to deliver a complete permissions solution:

- **Fine-grained ReBAC**: Leverages Permit.io, OPA, and OPAL to implement [relationship-based access control](https://www.permit.io/blog/what-is-rebac)
- **Multi-stage Security**: Implements a [five-stage authentication](/mcp-permissions/architecture/#five-stages-of-access-control) and authorization process
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Provides comprehensive auditing and anomaly detection capabilities
- **Flexible Deployment**: Supports various delivery models to meet different infrastructure needs
- **Human Oversight**: Enables human-in-the-loop (HITL) approvals for critical decisions

## Getting Started with Documentation

Our documentation is organized to help you understand and implement MCPermit effectively. Here's how to get started:

1. Review the [Overview](/mcp-permissions/overview/) to understand the core concepts and fundamental principles
2. Study the [Architecture](/mcp-permissions/architecture/) to learn about technical architecture and component interactions
3. Follow the [User Guide](/mcp-permissions/guide/) for practical implementation steps and best practices
