Keeping track of your workspace usage is essential to ensure that your team is operating at peak efficiency and that your
organization is getting the most out of Permit.

## Workspace Level Usage

To view your workspace usage, go to the **Projects** screen on the Sidebar.
The workspace usage is displayed in the top right corner of the screen.
In addition to the current usage, clicking on the (?) icon will show you the usage history of your workspace tenants and MAUs.

The environment usage is displayed in each environment's card, and there you can see the number of:
- **Tenants** in the environment

## MAUs & Tenants Usage

Permit.io calculates your billing based on the number of **Monthly Active Users** (MAUs) and **Tenants** in your workspace.

**Monthly Active Users (MAUs)** are the number of unique users (end-users) you check permissions for on a monthly basis.

**Tenants** represent a single instance of the application's environment, often used in multi-tenant architectures. Each tenant is a separate, isolated unit with its own set of users, data, configurations, and permissions.
