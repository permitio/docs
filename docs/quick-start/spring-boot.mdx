This guide shows you how to add access control to a Spring Boot application using Permit.io. You will set up a policy for creating posts and comments, register users, assign them roles (like Author, Moderator, or Reader), and enforce permissions directly in your app’s endpoints. By the end, you will have a working example where only authorized users can access protected endpoints, and you will understand how to integrate Permit.io into your own Spring Boot applications.

## Prerequisites

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running the PDP server)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (for installing and running the Permit CLI)
- [Permit.io](https://permit.io) account (Follow [this](/quickstart) guide to create an account)

<TimelineWrapper>
<TimelineStep>

### Installing the Permit CLI

First, install the [Permit CLI](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli). The Permit CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to create policies, run the PDP server, and perform other tasks. To install the CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g @permitio/cli
```

Once the installation is complete, run `permit` to confirm the installation.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Authenticating the CLI

To use the CLI, authenticate it with your Permit account. Run:

```bash
permit login
```

This command opens a browser window and prompts you to log in with your Permit account. After logging in, the CLI is authenticated and ready to use. This also logs you into the default environment (a project can have multiple environments).

You can change the environment by running `permit env select` and then selecting the environment you want to use.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Creating a policy with a template

The Permit CLI offers various templates to create a policy with predefined roles and resources using best practices. This saves you time and effort compared to creating a policy from scratch.

To check the available templates, run `permit template list`. You can also visit the [Permit CLI repo](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli/tree/main/source/templates) to see the templates and the actual terraform code for each template.

![permit template list](/img/quick-start-guide/permit-template-list.png)

Use the **blogging-platform** template to create the policy. This template helps you set up a policy for a blogging platform with roles and resources. The policy is explained in detail in the next step.

To apply the template, run the following command:

```bash
permit template apply --template blogging-platform
```

You will see a success message in the terminal.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Understanding and accessing the policy from the dashboard

Next, go to the Permit dashboard, select your project, and click on the **Policy** tab in the left sidebar. You will see the policy you just created.

![permit policy](/img/quick-start-guide/policy-editor-dash.png)

- For the blog application, there are two resources: **Posts** and **Comments**. Depending on the role and action, the user will have access to the resource. New users accessing the blog are assigned the **Reader** role and have permission to read posts.
- As users become **Authors**, they gain access to create and update blog posts and manage comments.
- There is also a relationship between **Post** and **Comment** resources: the person who creates a post automatically becomes a **Comment Moderator**.
- A **Free Post** resource set filters non-premium posts, allowing **Readers** to access only free content. This is a ReBAC setup.

This setup combines ABAC and ReBAC to enforce flexible and secure permissions. You can easily add or remove permissions by checking or unchecking them in the policy editor.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Getting the API key

To get the API key:

1. Click on **Projects** in the left sidebar.
2. Click on the three dots for the environment you want to use.
3. Click on **Copy API Key** and store it in a safe place. You will use this API key to authenticate your application with Permit.io. If you have any difficulty getting the API key, follow this [guide](/overview/connecting-your-app/#1-get-your-permit-environment-api-key).

Once you have the API key, proceed to integrate Permit.io with your Spring Boot application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Installing the Java SDK

Once you have a Spring Boot application ready (or you can create a new one for this guide), install the Permit Java SDK. Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.permit</groupId>
  <artifactId>permit-sdk-java</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Then install the dependency by running `mvn clean install`.

Read more about the Java SDK [here](/sdk/java/quickstart-java).

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the Spring Boot application with Permit.io

Start by creating a new Spring Boot application. Add the following code to your main application file:

```java
package com.example.permitdemo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class PermitdemoApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(PermitdemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the Permit controller

Create a `PermitController` class to handle the requests:

```java
package com.example.permitdemo;

import io.permit.sdk.Permit;
import io.permit.sdk.PermitConfig;
import io.permit.sdk.api.PermitApiError;
import io.permit.sdk.api.PermitContextError;
import io.permit.sdk.enforcement.Resource;
import io.permit.sdk.enforcement.User;
import io.permit.sdk.openapi.models.UserRead;
import io.permit.sdk.openapi.models.UserCreate;
import io.permit.sdk.openapi.models.TenantCreate;
import io.permit.sdk.openapi.models.TenantRead;
import io.permit.sdk.openapi.models.RoleAssignmentRead;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Map;

@RestController
public class PermitController {

    private final Permit permit;

    public PermitController(
            @Value("${PERMIT_API_KEY}") String apiKey,
            @Value("${PDP_URL:http://localhost:7766}") String pdpUrl
    ) {
        this.permit = new Permit(
                new PermitConfig.Builder(apiKey)
                        .withPdpAddress(pdpUrl)
                        .withDebugMode(true)
                        .build()
        );
    }    
}
```

The Permit SDK is initialized with the `PERMIT_API_KEY` (the API key you copied from the Permit dashboard) and the `PDP_URL` (the URL of the PDP server). You will set these up later.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Defining the endpoints

Inside the `PermitController` class, define the endpoints for your application:

```java
    // Register a user and assign the Reader role
    @PostMapping("/register")
    public ResponseEntity<?> register(@RequestBody Map<String, String> body) {
        String email = body.get("email");
        String firstName = body.get("first_name");
        String lastName = body.get("last_name");

        if (email == null || firstName == null || lastName == null) {
            return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(Map.of("error", "Missing required fields"));
        }

        try {
            UserRead user = permit.api.users.sync(
                    new UserCreate(email)
                            .withEmail(email)
                            .withFirstName(firstName)
                            .withLastName(lastName)
            ).getResult();
            // Assign a role to the user ("Reader" in tenant "default")
            RoleAssignmentRead roleAssignment = permit.api.users.assignRole(email, "Reader", "default");
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(Map.of(
                "message", "User registered and role assigned",
                "user", user,
                "role_assignment", roleAssignment
            ));
        } catch (IOException | PermitApiError | PermitContextError e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                    .body(Map.of("error", "Failed to sync user or assign role"));
        }
    }

    // Check if the user has access to create a post
    @PostMapping("/posts")
    public ResponseEntity<?> posts(@RequestBody Map<String, Object> body) {
        String userKey = (String) body.get("user");
        String action = "create";
        String resource = "Post";

        if (userKey == null) {
            return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(Map.of("error", "Missing required fields"));
        }

        try {
            User user = new User.Builder(userKey).build();
            Resource res = new Resource.Builder(resource).build();
            boolean permitted = permit.check(user, action, res);
            if (permitted) {
                return ResponseEntity.ok(Map.of("message", "User is permitted"));
            } else {
                return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN).body(Map.of("message", "User is not permitted"));
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                    .body(Map.of("error", "Permission check failed"));
        }
    }
```

- The `register` handler allows new users to register for the blog application and assigns them the **Reader** role, giving them access to read posts.
- The `posts` handler checks if a user has access to the **Post** resource. Since the blog application can have various elements like creating a post, commenting, editing, etc., create a new endpoint `/posts` to demonstrate access control. Only users with the **Author** role can create a post.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Testing the registration process

To demonstrate the registration process, run the Spring Boot application and use the `curl` command to make a request to the `/register` endpoint.

![curl create user](/img/quick-start-guide/spring-register-user.png)

As shown in the image above, the user is created successfully and you receive information about the user in the response, such as `id`, `project_id`, `key`, etc.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Giving the user access to the resource

The user is assigned the **Reader** role by default. Now, update the user to the **Author** role to allow them to create a post. To do this, use the Permit dashboard:

1. Select **Directory** from the left sidebar in the Permit dashboard.
2. Click the **Add Role** button.
3. Select tenant **(default)** from the dropdown.
4. Select the **Author** role and save it.

You will verify this later when you check the access.

![user access](/img/quick-start-guide/user-access.png)

You can also add more roles and resources as needed. Now, set up the PDP server and check the access.

:::info
You can grant access programmatically as well. This example demonstrates how easy it is to add access using the dashboard.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Setting up the PDP server

At this point, your application is ready with the user synced and the policy created. To enforce the policy, use [Permit's PDP](/concepts/pdp/overview) (Policy Decision Point) to check if the user has access to the resource. First, set up the PDP.

Run the following command to spin up your environment PDP in a Docker container:

```bash
permit pdp run
```

After you run the above command, you will see output with information such as container ID, name, etc.

![permit pdp run](/img/quick-start-guide/create-pdp.png)

The PDP server runs on port `7766` by default. You can change the port if needed. Finally, update the `PDP_URL` environment variable in your application.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Checking the access

Now, check the policy enforcement. Since you have added the user to the **Author** role, you can check if the user has **create** access to the **Post** resource. To do this, use the `curl` command to make a request to the `/check-permission` endpoint.

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/spring-user-permitted.png)

As shown in the image above, the user is permitted to access the resource. Remove the access from the dashboard and check again.

![curl check access](/img/quick-start-guide/spring-user-not-permitted.png)

This time, you can see that the user is not permitted to access the resource. This is how you can enforce policies using Permit.io with Spring Boot.

</TimelineStep>
</TimelineWrapper>

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to integrate Permit.io with Spring Boot. You created a simple Spring Boot application that syncs users and tenants with Permit.io. You also created endpoints to check the user's access to the resources. You used the Permit SDK to enforce policies and check access. You also set up the PDP server locally using Docker.
