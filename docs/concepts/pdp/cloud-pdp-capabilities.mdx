## What is the Cloud PDP?

The **Cloud PDP** is Permit's **managed Policy Decision Point** that runs in Permit.io's infrastructure and serves authorization decisions over HTTPS.
It exposes the same high‑level APIs as the container PDP and is **backward compatible** with existing SDK integrations that target
`https://cloudpdp.api.permit.io`.

Use the Cloud PDP when you want:

- **Managed infrastructure** – No containers, upgrades, or scaling to maintain.
- **High throughput & data volume** – Optimized for large‑scale policy checks.

For full control over deployment topology, network placement, and container‑level tuning, use the
[`permitio/pdp-v2` container PDP](/concepts/pdp/overview#run-an-edge-pdp-with-docker).

## Supported Policy Models

- **RBAC (Role‑Based Access Control)** – **Supported**
- **ReBAC (Relationship‑Based Access Control)** – **Supported**
- **Multi‑tenant authorization** – **Supported**

### Not Supported on Cloud PDP

- **ABAC (Attribute‑Based Access Control)** – **Not supported on Cloud PDP**  
  Use the container PDP when you need ABAC today.
- **Policy‑as‑Code (PBAC) / custom OPA bundles** – Not supported on Cloud PDP  
  Use the container PDP together with GitOps / PBAC flows for this use case.

Cloud PDP and the container PDP share the same policy model as defined in your Permit project; the main difference is **where**
the PDP runs and which runtime features you can configure yourself.

## Supported Permission Evaluation Types

The Cloud PDP supports the same core **permission evaluation types** as the container PDP for the models listed above:

- **`/allowed` – Single permission check**  
  See [Check](/how-to/enforce-permissions/check).
  - SDK: `permit.check(...)`
  - HTTP: `POST /allowed`
- **`/allowed/bulk` – Bulk permission checks**  
  See [Bulk Check](/how-to/enforce-permissions/bulk-check).
  - HTTP: `POST /allowed/bulk`
- **`/user-permissions` – User permissions for a subject**  
  See [User Permissions](/how-to/enforce-permissions/user-permissions).
  - "What can this user do?"
  - HTTP: `POST /user-permissions`
- **`/authorized_users` – Authorized users for a resource**  
  See [Authorized Users](/how-to/enforce-permissions/authorized-users).
  - "Which users are allowed to do X on Y?"
  - HTTP: `POST /authorized_users`
- **AuthZen (OpenID AuthZen Authorization API 1.0)** – standard evaluation and search APIs:
  - **Access Evaluation**: `POST /v1/access/evaluation`
  - **Bulk Access Evaluations**: `POST /v1/access/evaluations`
  - **Subject Search**: `POST /v1/subjects`
  - **Resource Search**: `POST /v1/resources`
  - **Action Search**: `POST /v1/actions`

:::note
The SDKs abstract most of these endpoints – in day‑to‑day usage you will primarily call higher‑level helpers on the client side.
:::

:::warning Container‑only helpers
The following helper APIs are **container PDP only** and are **not supported** by the Cloud PDP:

- [`permit.AllTenantsCheck`](/how-to/enforce-permissions/all-tenants-check) (all‑tenants check across a PDP cluster)
- Local enforcement APIs such as `/local/role_assignments`
  (see [`Local Enforcement APIs`](/how-to/enforce-permissions/list-role-assignments))
:::

## Observability & Logs

- **Audit logs & decision logs**
  - Cloud PDP sends decision logs to Permit Cloud and they appear in the **Audit Logs** UI and APIs in the **same format**
    as logs from the container PDP.
  - Any dashboards, filters, or exports you rely on today continue to work.
- **Debug Mode**
  - You can enable **Debug Mode** per environment or PDP configuration; this enriches decision logs with additional context.
  - For configuration details, see [Debug Mode](/how-to/use-audit-logs/debug-mode).

:::info
For the Cloud PDP, Debug Mode is managed via **Permit environment configuration** (UI/API).
You do **not** run or configure the Cloud PDP container directly.
:::

### Not Provided by Cloud PDP

Because the Cloud PDP is a **managed service**, some container‑level observability features are **not exposed**:

- No direct `/metrics` endpoint or custom metrics sink.
- No Helm‑based **logs forwarder** (Fluent Bit sidecar) configuration.
- No direct access to the underlying OPA process, OPAL services, or internal logs.

You should rely on:

- **Audit Logs** in the Permit dashboard.
- Application‑side metrics and logging around your PDP calls.

## Data Handling & Scale

The Cloud PDP is designed for **high data volume and high throughput**.
Policy and data ingestion, replication, and storage are fully managed by Permit.

- The Cloud PDP service is **continuously and consistently updated, secured, and operated by Permit** (patching, upgrades, performance tuning).
- With the container PDP, **you own the operational lifecycle** (image upgrades, rollout strategies, observability stack, etc.).

- You **do not** manage any embedded data engines for the Cloud PDP.
- You **cannot** configure OPAL Scope or custom data sources for the Cloud PDP – instead, you load data into Permit as **users, resource instances, tenants, relationship tuples, and role assignments**, and the Cloud PDP consumes that managed data.
- You get a single, stable HTTPS endpoint that serves decisions for your project/environment.

If you need full control over:

- Custom external data sources via OPAL Scope.
- Embedded data stores or other on-disk state inside the PDP container.
- Consistent updates / read‑your‑own‑writes behavior using the Local Facts **Send Consistent Updates** feature (see [Send Consistent Updates](/how-to/manage-data/local-facts-uploader)).
- Offline mode, backups, and network path to Permit Cloud.

then you should use the **container PDP** instead.

## When to Use Which?

- **Use Cloud PDP when**:
  - You want a **fully managed**, production‑ready PDP with minimal operational overhead.
  - You need to support **RBAC and ReBAC** at high scale without running containers.
  - You rely on standard permission evaluations such as `check` / `/allowed`, `/allowed/bulk`, `/user-permissions`, `/authorized_users`, and the AuthZen API endpoints.

- **Use the container PDP when**:
  - You need **ABAC** support today.
  - You require fine‑grained control over deployment topology, networks, and scaling.
  - You depend on **local helper APIs**, custom data sources, or advanced observability.
