## What makes up an ABAC Policy?

With ABAC, organization access policies enforce access decisions based on the attributes of the **subject**, **resource**,
**action**, and **environment** involved in an access event. We will go into detail of each one with a simple example.

### Subject

The subject is the user requesting access to a resource in order to perform a certain action.
Subject attributes in a user profile could include the **employee ID**, **job role**, **group memberships**,
**departmental and organizational memberships**, **management level**, **security clearance** and other
identifying criteria.

We can often get a lot of this data during the login procedure from an authentication token, or from an HR system or directory.

:::info example
Jessica is an employee of **company X**. Her job role is a **Product Manager**. She belongs to several groups like **marketing** and
**community management**. Jessica works **Monday-Friday** from **9am to 5pm**. She is responsible for product-focused **expenses** and
has access to the **company credit card**.
:::

### Resource

The resource is **the asset or object** (it could be a file, application, server, or even API) that the subject **wants to access**.
Resource attributes are all identifying characteristics, like a file's creation date, its owner, file name and type, and data
sensitivity.

:::info example
A **company credit card** owned by **company X** with **strict spending limits**.
:::

### Action

The action is **what the user is trying to do with the resource**. Common action attributes include "read", "write", "edit",
"copy" and "delete". In some cases, multiple attributes can describe an action. Actions of course can get much more complex than
the ones provided here.

:::info example
Jessica want's to use the **company credit card** to **subscribe** to a **membership plan**, giving co-workers access to internal tools.
:::

### Environment

The environment is the **broader context of each access request**. All environmental attributes speak to contextual factors
like the time and location of an access attempt, the subject's device, communication protocol and encryption strength.

:::info example
Jessica can only use her **company credit card** to purchase a **subscription** during her **working hours**, and as long
as she is **in the USA** and **connected to the company secure network**.
