description: "How to deploy the Permit PDP to Prod"
---

When deploying to production, you might want to work with a local PDP (A Policy-Decision-Point microservice) within your VPC.
The PDP is easy to install via Docker, and will ensure **zero-latency, great performance, high availability, and improved security**.
Like all Permit customer deployed components, the [Permit PDP is open-source](https://github.com/permitio/PDP).

## Installing the PDP

Pull our PDP container from Docker Hub [(Click here to install Docker)](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/):

```sh
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

Run the container & replace the `PDP_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key.

```sh
docker run -it \
  -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  --env PDP_DEBUG=True \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

### Running the PDP with Organization/Project API Key
In some cases, you might want to use an Organization or Project API Key to authenticate with the PDP - instead of using the Environment API Key.
That's useful when you want to have a single API Key for all your environments, or when you want to have a separate API Key for each of your projects - which is also great to reduce operations around Secrets management, one API Key (or few) to rule them all.

To do that, you can set the `PDP_ORG_API_KEY` or `PDP_PROJECT_API_KEY` environment variable instead of `PDP_API_KEY`.
In addition -
- When setting Organization API Key, you'll need to set the `PDP_ACTIVE_ENV` and `PDP_ACTIVE_PROJECT` environment variables with the ID or Key of the environment and project you want to use.
- When setting Project API Key, you'll need to set the `PDP_ACTIVE_ENV` environment variable with the ID or Key of the environment you want to use.

For example, to run the PDP with an Organization API Key:
```sh
docker run -it \
  -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_ORG_API_KEY=<YOUR_ORG_API_KEY> \
  --env PDP_ACTIVE_PROJECT=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID_OR_KEY> \
  --env PDP_ACTIVE_ENV=<YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID_OR_KEY> \
  --env PDP_DEBUG=True \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

And here's an example of running the PDP with a Project API Key:
```sh
docker run -it \
  -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_PROJECT_API_KEY=<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY> \
  --env PDP_ACTIVE_ENV=<YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID_OR_KEY> \
  --env PDP_DEBUG=True \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

## Using the PDP

The PDP will listen on port `7766` by default, so all you have to do is to set your PDP_URL in our SDK initialization to
`http://localhost:7766` and you're good to go.

For example in Node.js:

```js
const permit = new Permit({
  pdp: "http://localhost:7766",
  token: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
});
```

## Exposing OPA within the PDP

Similar to a regular run of the PDP, with the addition of a single port mapping (`-p 8181:8181`)
Run the container & replace the `PDP_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key.

```sh
docker run -it \
  -p 7766:7000 \
  -p 8181:8181 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  --env PDP_DEBUG=True \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

## System Requirements and Performance Optimization

When deploying your PDP in production, consider the following system requirements and performance tips to ensure optimal operation:

### Where to start

CPU & memory requirements would obviously deeply depend on the scale of your application, but here are some good values to start with:

- CPU: ~200 mcores. but enable upper limit of at least ~1000 mcores to enable short CPU spikes and keep the PDP responsive
- Memory: ~512Mb

### Scaling CPU

Processing demands of PDP would depend on the number of requests it has to handle, as well as the complexity of the queried policies.
When CPU usage becomes a bottleneck, you can scale the PDP horizontally by deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer (e.g. scale replicas of Kubernetes deployment),
thus distributing the load and increasing the number of requests the PDP can handle.

### Scaling Memory

Memory usage of the PDP would depend on the volume of data in your environment.
PDP makes use of OPA to achieve very fast policy evaluation, this speed of evaluation is achieved by:

- Storing the environment's policy data in its entirety in local process's memory.
- Using redundant data structures and caches.
  This means that scaling of your environment's policy data requires vertical scaling of the PDP's memory.
  And while exact requirements would depend on many factors (e.g. what attributes your objects have, complexity of relations between objects when ReBAC is used),
  we can suggest using the formula of _`# of policy objects X 6kb`_ (where policy objects include: users, resource instances & tenants) as a rough estimate.
  For example: For environment of 100k users, 500k resource instances and 100 tenants, you'll need ~3.5Gb of memory.

For multi-tenant environments, data / memory can be scaled horizontally by using [tenant based sharding](/how-to/manage-data/pdp-sharding).

### General Performance Tips

To achieve high throughput and low latency:

- **Use a Local PDP**: Deploy the PDP in the same VPC as your application to minimize network latency.
- **Disable Decision Debug Info**: In production, you can turn off decision debug information to enhance performance. Disable debug logging by adding `--env PDP_DEBUG=False` to the PDP command line.
- **Optimize Base Policy**: Tailor the base policy to your specific use case. For example, disabling ReBAC checks (if not used) can speed up policy execution (this requires our tech support).
  With these optimizations, you can expect several thousand RPS with less than 10ms latency per request.


## PDP Offline Mode

The PDP relies on Permit's cloud for fetching configuration, loading policies, and keeping those up to date.
Despite the high availability of Permit's cloud, there still might be cases when the PDP can't reach it.
For extra resilience, the PDP can be configured to work in offline mode, where it will use a local backup of the configuration and policies.

### How it works
When the PDP is started in offline mode, it will try to fetch the configuration from Permit's cloud as usual.
After `PDP_CONFIG_FETCH_MAX_RETRIES` failed attempts, the PDP will switch to offline mode and use the backup configuration file if present.
Once PDP is up and running - it won't try to fetch the configuration again from cloud, unless it's restarted.

For backing up the policies (both data & rules loaded to policy store), PDP internally uses [OPAL's offline mode](https://docs.opal.ac/getting-started/running-opal/run-opal-client/opa-runner-parameters/#policy-store-backup) 
(no need to explicitly enable OPAL's offline mode, PDP would do it automatically).
OPAL uses policy data from the backup file to initialy load the policy store, but it never gives up on syncing with cloud - so once Permit cloud is reachable again, the most updated policy data could be fetched.
Policy data backup is done periodically (to the same directory as the configuration backup file), and also on a graceful shutdown of the PDP.


### Configuring Offline Mode

To enable the PDP offline mode, use the `PDP_ENABLE_OFFLINE_MODE` environment variable.
You would also have to mount a volume or a host directory to the PDP container at `/app/backup`, where the backup files will be persisted.
When PDP offline mode is enabled, the PDP will automatically enable OPAL's offline mode, and will use the backup files from the mounted volume.

```sh
docker run -it -p 7766:7000 -p 8181:8181 
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  --env PDP_ENABLE_OFFLINE_MODE=true \
  -v <HOST_BACKUP_DIR_OR_NAMED_VOLUME>:/app/backup
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

There are serverl other advanced configuration options you can use:
* `PDP_OFFLINE_MODE_BACKUP_DIR` Sets the directory path of the PDP's configuration backup file (default "/app/backup")
* `PDP_OFFLINE_MODE_BACKUP_FILENAME` Sets the file name of the PDP's configuration backup file (default "pdp_cloud_config_backup.json")
* `PDP_OFFLINE_MODE_POLICY_BACKUP_FILENAME` Sets the file name of the PDP's policy store backup file within the backup dir. This replaces OPAL's `OPAL_STORE_BACKUP_PATH`. (default "policy_store_backup.json")
* `PDP_CONFIG_FETCH_MAX_RETRIES` - Would determine after how many retries (to fetch cloud configuration) the PDP should switch to offline mode (default: 6)
* `OPAL_STORE_BACKUP_INTERVAL` - Determines how often would the policy store backup be saved. (default: 1m)

### Security Considerations

PDP's configuration backup file is securely encrypted on disk using a key derived from your secret `PDP_API_KEY` token.
Currently OPAL's backup file of the policy store is not encrypted, so make sure to secure the mounted host directory / volume where the backup files are stored. (let us know if that's something you need).
