# Deploying PDP to local Kubernetes using terraform

In this example, we will show you how to deploy the Permit PDP on Kubernetes using terraform.

Resources included in this example:

- Deployment
- Service
- Secret

## To deploy the PDP on local Kubernetes by terraform, follow these steps:

1. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/permitio/permit-pdp-deployments-examples
```
2. 
```bash
cd ./terraform
```
3.
```bash
terraform init
```
4. Make sure to replace <API_KEY> placeholder at main.tf file with your API KEY
5. 
```bash
terraform plan
```
6. 
```bash
terraform apply
```

Once the PDP is ready, you can start sending authorization requests to it.

## Interacting with the PDP

To interact with the PDP **internally** (from inside the cluster), you can use the service name `permitio-pdp.<Your Namespace>.svc.cluster.local`.

To interact with the PDP **externally** (from outside the cluster), you must expose the service using a load balancer or an ingress of your choice.
