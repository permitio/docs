# Deploying PDP using helm

In this example, we will show you how to deploy the Permit PDP on Kubernetes using helm.

Resources included in this example:

- Deployment
- Service
- Secret

## To deploy the PDP on Kubernetes, follow these steps:

1. Add helm repo:
```bash
helm repo add pdp https://permitio.github.io/sidecar
```
2. In order to see all available versions and also make sure the helm repo added successfully:
```bash
helm search repo pdp
```
3. Make sure to replace API_KEY placeholder with your API KEY and perform helm install command:
```bash
helm install pdp pdp/pdp --set pdp.ApiKey=<API_KEY> --create-namespace --namespace pdp --wait
```

Once the PDP is ready, you can start sending authorization requests to it.

## Interacting with the PDP

To interact with the PDP **internally** (from inside the cluster), you can use the service name `permitio-pdp.<Your Namespace>.svc.cluster.local`.

To interact with the PDP **externally** (from outside the cluster), you must expose the service using a load balancer or an ingress of your choice.
