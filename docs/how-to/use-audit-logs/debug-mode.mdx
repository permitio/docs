---

Knowing why some decisions were made by your PDP can be a crutial part of buidling and understanding your policies, especially when you encounter unexpected results.
That's what **Debug Mode** is here for.

## What is Debug mode?

Permit's Debug Mode adds additional debug information to your decision logs, allowing for an in-depth analysis of the decisions made by your [PDP](/concepts/pdp).

## The advantages of Debug Mode

On top of standard log information provided by our Audit Logs, Debug Mode allows us to understand -

- Why a decision was made
- Which policy was taken into consideration for the evaluation process
- What are the policies currently configured in your environment

This information gives you a more granular understanding of any decision made by the PDP.

:::warning
Turning on Debug Mode will impact policy evaluation latency. Thus, it is recommended to disable Debug Mode when running in production.

## Activating Debug Mode

There are two possible ways to activate Debug Mode:

### Through the PDP environment variables:

When running your PDP, set the environment variable `PDP_DEBUG=True` as part of the PDP deployment.
This will activate Debug Mode for this specific PDP.

Here's an example of such a PDP deployment:

```
docker run -it \
  -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  --env PDP_DEBUG=True
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

:::note
This configuration will only enable Debug Mode in the PDP itself and not across your environment.

### Through the UI (Coming Soon)

Another option to enable Debug Mode is through Permit's UI. To do that:

1. Go to your Permit dashboard and make sure you have the relevant project and environment selected.
2. Next, go to the **Audit Log** screen.
3. In the top right corner, click on **Settings**.
4. Click the toggle to enable Debug Mode.
