title: Debug Mode
---


Knowing why some decisions were made by your PDP can be a crutial part of buidling and understanding your policies, especially when you encounter unexpected results.
That's what **Debug Mode** is here for.

## What is Debug mode?

Permit's Debug Mode adds additional debug information to your decision logs, allowing for an in-depth analysis of the decisions made by your [PDP](/concepts/pdp/overview).

## The advantages of Debug Mode

On top of standard log information provided by our Audit Logs, Debug Mode allows us to understand -

- Why a decision was made
- Which policy was taken into consideration for the evaluation process
- What are the policies currently configured in your environment

This information gives you a more granular understanding of any decision made by the PDP.

:::warning
Turning on Debug Mode will impact policy evaluation latency. Thus, it is recommended to disable Debug Mode when running in production.

## Configuring Debug Mode

There are few possible ways to configure Debug Mode:

### Through the PDP environment variables:

When running your PDP, set the environment variable `PDP_DEBUG` as part of the PDP deployment. <br />
There available configurations are:
- `PDP_DEBUG=None` - The default behavior, will use the configuration set by Permit.io Cloud.
- `PDP_DEBUG=True` - Will enable Debug Mode for this specific PDP.
- `PDP_DEBUG=False` - Will disable Debug Mode for this specific PDP.

Here's an example of such a PDP deployment:

```
docker run -it \
  -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  --env PDP_DEBUG=True \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

:::note
This configuration will only enable Debug Mode in the PDP itself and not across your environment.
:::

### Through the Permit API

Updating the Debug Mode configuration can also be done via the Permit API.
To do se you can use the following guide:

1. Extract the relevant PDP Configuration from the Permit API:
    ```bash
    curl "https://api.permit.io/v2/pdps/{proj_id}/{env_id}/configs" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {api-key}"
    ```
2. Update the setting for the relevant PDP Configuration using the id retrieved from the previous call:
    - To enable use the following command
        ```bash
        curl "https://api.permit.io/v2/pdps/{proj_id}/{env_id}/configs/{pdp_id}/debug-audit-logs/enable" \
        -X PUT \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer {api-key}"
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
        ```
    - To disable use the following command
        ```bash
        curl "https://api.permit.io/v2/pdps/{proj_id}/{env_id}/configs/{pdp_id}/debug-audit-logs/disable" \
        -X PUT \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer {api-key}"
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
        ```

:::note
Updating the configuration via the API will affect all PDPs using the updated PDP Configuration in the environment.<br />
The PDP Config the PDP is using is determined based on the API Key the PDP runs with.

### Through the UI (Coming Soon)

Another option to enable Debug Mode is through Permit's UI. To do that:

1. Go to your Permit dashboard and make sure you have the relevant project and environment selected.
2. Next, go to the **Audit Log** screen.
3. In the top right corner, click on **Settings**.
4. Click the toggle to change the default Debug Mode behavior on the PDPs in this environment.


:::note Default Behavior & Superseding Hierarchy
The configuration hierarchy for Debug Mode is as follows:
- If no configuration was set, the PDP will show debug information.
- If the configuration was set on Permit.io Cloud, the PDP will use that configuration.
- If the configuration was set on the PDP itself, it will override the Permit.io Cloud configuration.
- If the API/SDK Call to the PDP was done with `use_debugger` in the body, it will override any other configuration set.

:::warning Performance Impact
Having debug mode activated has a performance penalty and is recommended to run
with it disabled on production environments.<br />
