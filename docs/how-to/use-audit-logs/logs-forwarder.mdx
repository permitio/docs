In order to forward logs to your preferred logging platform, you can use the Permit Logs Forwarder.
Currently we support forwarding logs to ElasticSearch and stdout of the FluentBit container.

## What is FluentBit

Fluent Bit is a lightweight, and highly scalable logging and metrics processor and forwarder.
Fluent Bit CNCF graduated project under the umbrella of Fluentd.
For more information **[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/)**.

## Enabling Logs Forwarder

Use the PDP's **[values.yaml](https://github.com/permitio/PDP/blob/v2/charts/pdp/values.yaml)**:
1. Swtich ```pdp.logs_forwarder.enabled``` to ```true```.
2. Set the ```pdp.logs_forwarder.type``` to the desired log forwarder type, ```elasticsearch``` or ```stdout```.
2.1 If you choose ElasticSearch, set the ```pdp.logs_forwarder.elasticsearch.host``` to the desired ElasticSearch host.
2.2 If you choose ElasticSearch, set the ```pdp.logs_forwarder.elasticsearch.port``` to the desired ElasticSearch port.
2.3 If you choose ElasticSearch, set the ```pdp.logs_forwarder.elasticsearch.index``` to the desired ElasticSearch index.
2.4 If you choose ElasticSearch, set the ```pdp.logs_forwarder.elasticsearch.cloud_auth``` to the desired ElasticSearch username and password as the following ```{user}:{password}```.
3. Optional - Set the ```pdp.logs_forwarder.debug_mode``` to ```true``` to enable debug logs of FluentBit container.

## How it works

Once pdp.logs_forwarder.enabled is set to true, the logs will be forwarded to the desired log forwarder type by FluentBit sidecar container.
The PDP container will save the logs to ```/tmp/pdp.log``` file, and the FluentBit sidecar container will read the logs from this file, filtering the Decision Logs and forward them to the desired log forwarder type.
