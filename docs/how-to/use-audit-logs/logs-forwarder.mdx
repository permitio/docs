In order to forward logs to your preferred logging platform, you can use the Permit Logs Forwarder.
Currently we support forwarding logs to ElasticSearch and stdout of the fluentbit container.

## How to enable Logs Forwarder

Under **[values.yaml](https://github.com/permitio/PDP/blob/v2/charts/pdp/values.yaml)**:
1. Swtich **pdp.logs_forwarder.enabled** to true in values.yaml file.
2. Set the **pdp.logs_forwarder.type** to the desired log forwarder type. Currently we support elasticsearch and stdout.
2.1 If you choose elasticsearch, set the **pdp.logs_forwarder.elasticsearch.host** to the desired elasticsearch host.
2.2 If you choose elasticsearch, set the **pdp.logs_forwarder.elasticsearch.port** to the desired elasticsearch port.
2.3 If you choose elasticsearch, set the **pdp.logs_forwarder.elasticsearch.index** to the desired elasticsearch index.
2.4 If you choose elasticsearch, set the **pdp.logs_forwarder.elasticsearch.cloud_auth** to the desired elasticsearch username and password {user}:{password}.
3. Optional - Set the **pdp.logs_forwarder.debug_mode** to true to enable debug logs of fluentbit container.

## How it's works

Once pdp.logs_forwarder.enabled is set to true, the logs will be forwarded to the desired log forwarder type by fluentbit sidecar container.
The PDP container will save the logs to /tmp/pdp.log file, and the fluentbit sidecar container will read the logs from this file, filtering the Decision Logs and forward them to the desired log forwarder type.
