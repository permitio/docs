title: Tenant not found
---

The error you encountered arises from an unrecognized tenant in the permit check. Ensure you're entering the correct tenant name,
taking into account its case sensitivity.

### A solution to the issue

#### Create a tenant with a user and roles using Permit web application

Begin by creating a new tenant using our [Tenant Management Screen](https://app.permit.io/user-management/tenants).
Once established, you can add users and assign roles to them within this tenant through our
[User Management Screen](https://app.permit.io/user-management/users).

#### Create a tenant with a user and roles via the API

Initiate by setting up a tenant using our [Tenant Management API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Tenants/operation/create_tenant).
Following that, the API allows for user creation and role assignment within the newly created tenant. For more details, refer to our
documentation on [creating a user](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Users/operation/create_user) and
[assigning roles](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Role-Assignments/operation/assign_role).

#### Create a tenant with a user and roles via the SDK

With the help of our [Python SDK](https://docs.permit.io/sdk/python/tenant/create-tenant),
[Node SDK](https://docs.permit.io/sdk/nodejs/tenant/create-tenant), or other available SDKs, you can establish a new tenant. Post creation,
these SDKs offer functionalities to add users and allocate roles within the designated tenant. For further guidance, explore our
comprehensive [SDK documentation](/sdk/sdks-overview).
