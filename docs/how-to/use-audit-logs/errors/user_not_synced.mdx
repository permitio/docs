title: User not synced error
---

This error arises when attempting to check permissions for a user that hasn't been synchronized with your application. This commonly
occurs if a user is created within your authentication provider dashboard but hasn't yet been synced to Permit. Please note that the user
key is case-sensitive—ensure its accuracy.

## A solution to the issue

### Sync the user to permit with Permit web application

Navigate to our [Users Management Screen](https://app.permit.io/user-management) within the Permit web application. Here, you can create and
verify if the user is synchronized.

### Sync the user to permit with the API

Use our [API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Users/operation/create_user) to both create and synchronize the user with Permit.

### Sync the user to permit with the SDK

Leverage the SDK to create and synchronize the user to Permit. Explore [Python SDK](/sdk/python/usage-example#create-or-update-a-user-sync-user),
[Node SDK](/sdk/nodejs/user/sync-user), and [additional SDKs](/sdk/sdks-overview) for details.
