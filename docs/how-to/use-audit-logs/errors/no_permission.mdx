title: No permission found for user to this action on this resource

You encountered this error because either your user account lacks the appropriate role to carry out the desired action, or the existing
role needs additional permissions.

## A solution to the issue

### Assigning Permissions via the Permit Web Application

Utilize the [Policy Editor](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor) in the Permit web application to allocate this permission to a user role.
Simply select the appropriate action for the desired resource and click 'save' to propagate the changes to the PDP.

### Assign Permissions to User Roles via the API

To delegate this permission to a user role using the API, refer to the [redoc documentation](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Role-Assignments/operation/assign_role).
