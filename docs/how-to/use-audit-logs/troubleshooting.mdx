There are **several reasons** why you might be **unable to see logs** in the audit log page.

## Reason 1: Environment

To view the appropriate audit logs, please ensure the correct active environment is selected. You can easily switch between environments on the
**[Projects](https://app.permit.io/projects)** page by clicking the corresponding Set as active environment button.

## Reason 2: Your App is not connected

Make sure you have successfully connected Permit SDK or the API to your app.

Make sure you have installed Permit correctly with the latest version, initialized the Permit object and performed a simple `permit.check()`.
You can read more about structuring your enforcements in the [enforcing permissions guide](/how-to/enforce-permissions/check).

As part of the [Quickstart guide](/overview/glossary), you need to [run the PDP](/overview/connecting-your-app#1-pull-our-pdp-container-from-docker-hub) with the right environment key. Make sure you are using the right key for the environment
you are running in.

## Reason 3: PDP container isn't running

One of the reasons that logs will not appear in the audit log screen is because your PDP container is not running in the background.

If this is the case, you will see that your **user is not permitted to perform actions** regardless of the user's roles and permissions.

To fix this issue, follow the instructions on how to run Permit available in the **[Quickstart](/overview/glossary)** guide.

## Reason 4: Filters prevents logs from appearing

If you applied a filter on the audit log page, your audits might not appear.

To remove the filters, simply **refresh** the audit log page.
