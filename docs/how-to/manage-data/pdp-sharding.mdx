[PDP](/overview/glossary#pdp) Sharding is a technique for scaling Policy Decision Points (PDPs) horizontally,
by splitting the data into multiple PDPs, each responsible for a subset of your tenants.

Scaling up data with PDP sharding

## When to use PDP Sharding

PDP Sharding is useful when you need to scale your PDP horizontally,
In some cases it is more cost effective to run multiple smaller PDPs, than a single large one because the policy engines
might not handle large amount of data as quickly as you need them to.

# How it works ?

Each PDP is run with a specific shard ID (a number between 0 and the number of shards - 1),
each shard will have only the data of the tenants associated with it.
On top of your PDPs an [Envoy server](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/) will proxy each authorization query request to handle the consistent hashing algorithm
that will be used to map each request by its tenant to the consistent shard responsible for it.
This is done by utilizing Envoy's native support for “Hash ring” load balancing.
That is, choosing an upstream host using a consistent hashing algorithm (“Ketama”).

Data changes tracked by Permit.io are propagated to the specific PDP shard that is responsible for associated with them. The same consistent hashing algorithm will be used to map the data to the correct shard.

## Basic Architecture

The flow of an authorization request will be as follows:
![Authorization Request](/img/diagrams/sharded-pdps-diagram.svg)

To achieve sharding, multiple PDPs should be run.
Currently, a predetermined number of PDPs is assumed, although dynamic scaling would be available soon as well (upcoming feature).

For each SDK query to reach the correct PDP instance (holding the shard that has the correct tenant id), we are using Envoy.
The SDK is configured with Envoy’s address as its PDP, and Envoy forwards the requests based on the Tenant ID to the corresponding PDP.
Permit.io's backend uses that very same sharding algorithm, Thus both the locally deployed Envoy proxy and the Permit.io backend are mapping the same tenant ids to the same shard ids.

## Quickstart

An Envoy container with a custom configuration should be deployed next to the set of PDPs.
See quick guide [here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/start/quick-start/run-envoy#override-the-default-configuration).
The following steps will guide you through the process of setting up 7 shards PDP cluster with Envoy:

1. Create the envoy configuration file named `envoy_custom.yaml` :

   ```yaml
   admin:
     address:
       socket_address: { address: 0.0.0.0, port_value: 9901 }
   static_resources:
     listeners:
       - name: sdk_requests
         address:
           socket_address: { address: 0.0.0.0, port_value: 10000 }
         filter_chains:
           - filters:
               - name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager
                 typed_config:

                   codec_type: AUTO
                   route_config:
                     name: local_route
                     virtual_hosts:
                       - name: local_service
                         domains: ["*"]
                         routes:
                           - match: { prefix: "/" }
                             route:
                               cluster: pdp_cluster
                               hash_policy:
                                 - header:
                                     header_name: X-Tenant-Id
                   http_filters:

                         hash_key: "6"
   ```

2. Perform HTTP request to notify a migration to sharded PDP cluster is being made ( this request must be done with env level api-key ), the response json will contain a `client_secret` that should be used in the next steps as the new cluster PDP_API_KEY:

   ```bash
   curl https://api.permit.io/v2/pdps/{proj_id}/{env_id}/configs/migrate-shards \
   -X POST \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <PDP_API_KEY>" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
       "num_shards": 7
   }'
   ```

3. Copy the following docker-compose file to your local machine and replace the '<PDP_API_KEY>' with your API key and '<PATH_TO_ENVOY_CONV>' with the path to the envoy configuration file you created in step 1:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"

       name: pdp-net
   services:

         - PDP_SHARD_ID=0
       ports:

       networks:

         - PDP_SHARD_ID=4
       ports:

     pdp-shard-5:

         - PDP_SHARD_ID=5
       ports:
         - "18185:8181"
     pdp-shard-6:
       image: permitio/pdp-v2:0.2.19-rc.1
       networks:

       environment:
         - PDP_API_KEY=<PDP_API_KEY>
         - PDP_SHARD_ID=6
       ports:
         - "18186:8181"
   ```

4. Execute the docker-compose file using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. Perform HTTP request to notify a migration to sharded PDP cluster is being made ( this request must be done with env level api-key ), the response json will contain a `client_secret` that should be used in the next steps as the new cluster PDP_API_KEY:

   ```bash
   curl https://api.permit.io/v2/pdps/{proj_id}/{env_id}/configs/migrate-shards \
   -X POST \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <PDP_API_KEY>" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
       "num_shards": 7
   }'
   ```

6. Copy the following docker-compose file to your local machine and replace the '<PDP_API_KEY>' with your API key and '<PATH_TO_ENVOY_CONV>' with the path to the envoy configuration file you created in step 1:

   ```yaml

       environment:
         - PDP_API_KEY=<PDP_API_KEY>
         - PDP_SHARD_ID=0
       ports:
         - "18180:8181"
     pdp-shard-1:

         - PDP_SHARD_ID=2
       ports:
         - "18182:8181"
     pdp-shard-3:
       image: permitio/pdp-v2:0.2.19-rc.1
       networks:

       environment:
         - PDP_API_KEY=<PDP_API_KEY>
         - PDP_SHARD_ID=5
       ports:

         - PDP_SHARD_ID=6
       ports:
         - "18186:8181"
   ```

7. Execute the docker-compose file using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

Finally you can send an authorization check request to the Envoy container:

<Tabs groupId="language">

```bash
curl http://localhost:10000/allowed \
    -X POST \
    -H "X-Tenant-Id: default" \

    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
            "user": {

            },
                "action": "read"
