title: Use External Data Source
---

Using the OPAL Scope Config API, you can set your own data sources to be fetched and loaded into your PDPs using OPAL.
This allows using data without needing to share it with Permit's control plane.

To make changes to the OPAL Scope, use the
[OPAL Scope API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Scope-Configurations). Simply include the
project and environment IDs in the API endpoint URL - don't worry, our guide can show you where to find them.

Out of the box, Permit automatically pulls in details about users, roles, and more from its cloud database to the PDP's policy engine, 
setting a solid foundation for your policy.<br />

To view the the data structure loaded into PDPs used by default check out the API reference and the example [here](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/OPAL-Data-(-EAP-)).
Notice that this API is in EAP stage might be subject to changes !

## How to use External Data Sources in Permit

To manage attributes from an external data-source and use them with Permit's Auto-Generated Rego Policies, you will need
to set up small bindings beside the Scope configuration, this guide will also show you how to do that.<br/>
*Any attributes in following rules will be merged with the attributes you store in Permit & the attributes you provide in the input.*
*The merge is done with the following rules input > custom > stored.*<br/>
The currently supported external attributes are:<br/>
1. `custom_user_attributes` - User attributes to be merged with the stored & input attributes.
2. `custom_tenant_attributes` - Tenant attributes to be merged with the stored & input attributes.
3. `custom_resource_attributes` - Resource attributes to be merged with the stored & input attributes.
4. `custom_context_attributes` - Context attributes to be merged with the input attributes.

For instance, in this guide, we'll show you how to add information from around the world using data
from [https://restcountries.com](https://restcountries.com).

We will get the data from the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com) and set it as a
under `countries` key in the data object using custom data source in the OPAL Scope.
This will allow us to use the data in our Rego policies.

1. Configure custom data sources using Permit API
    You can specify the path in the json in which the fetched data will be stored using the `dst_path` attribute.

    ```
    curl --location --request PUT 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/{project_id}/{env_id}/opal_scope' \

    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

    --header 'Accept: application/json' \

    --header 'Authorization: Bearer permit_key_***' \

    --data '{

      "data": {

           "entries": [

                {

                     "url": "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all",

                     "dst_path": "/countries",

                     "config": {

                          "headers": {

                               "Accept": "application/json"

                          }

                     }

                }

           ]

      }

    }'
    ```

    :::note
    You can see the data stored inside OPA by running the following command:
    ```bash
     curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8181/v1/data' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer permit*key* {{secret}}'
    ```
    :::

2. You can define custom attributes in your rego policies,
    to do so we need to add something similar to the following code in the `custom` directory in your [gitops](/integrations/gitops/overview) repo:

    ```rego
    package permit.custom
    import future.keywords.in

    region_by_common_name[name] := region {
     some _,country in data.countries
     name := country.name.common
     region := country.region
    }

    custom_user_attributes["region"] := region_by_common_name[data.users[input.user.key].attributes.country]
    ```

    By adding this we can now know the region of the user based on the country they are in using the attributes we've loaded
    from the external data source.
    Similar to this you can add any custom attributes you want to use in your policies from any external data source.
    For example, you can load data from stripe and add billing attributes for your users to use in your policies.
3. Define ABAC conditions using by following this [guide](/how-to/build-policies/abac/building-abac-policy#define-a-user-set).
4. That's it! The custom attributes are now used in your policies.

You can view the full OPAL Scope documentation **[here](https://docs.opal.ac/getting-started/running-opal/run-opal-server/data-sources)**.

:::info
**Custom scopes are supported from PDP v0.2.15**
:::

Make sure you have pulled the latest PDP container.

```bash
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

Make sure you have enabled the _`OPAL_SPLIT_ROOT_DATA`_ flag when running the container.

```bash
OPAL_SPLIT_ROOT_DATA=1
```

For example, if you are running it with docker, it will look like the example below:

```bash
docker run -e PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR-PERMIT-API-KEY> -e OPAL_SPLIT_ROOT_DATA=1 permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

If the GitOps feature is activated in your account, you can enhance your Rego policies by integrating data from the custom
data source as illustrated below:

```json
data.countries[0].capital == "Bridgetown"
```
