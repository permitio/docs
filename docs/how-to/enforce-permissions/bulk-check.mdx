The permit `bulkCheck()` function allows you to validate multiple permission requests in a single call.

---

For some use cases, you might need to perform multiple `check()` calls at once.
To support that, Permit provides a `bulkCheck` function that allows you to validate multiple permission requests in a single call.
In its basic form, the bulk `check()` function accepts the same parameters as the `check()` function, but in an array.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/bulk-check" />

## Use Cases

Below are some examples of the use cases that require the use of the `bulkCheck()` function:

### Latency Sensitive Applications

The most basic usage of a `bulkCheck` is to save time when multiple check calls are needed in one scope.
For example, assuming we have an API endpoint that performs multiple actions on a resource, we can use the `bulkCheck` function to check all the permissions at once.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/bulk-check/latency-applications" />

### Multiple Policy Models

In some cases, we want to perform ReBAC and ABAC checks for the same operations.
For example, if `edit` is a premium feature in our application (with ABAC) and we also want to check if the user has access to `edit` a document (with ReBAC), we can use the `bulkCheck` function to check both permissions at once.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/bulk-check/multiple-policy-models" />

### Data Filtering

Data filtering is where we have a collection of data, and we want to filter it based on the permissions of the user.
While there are more efficient ways to perform data filtering with Permit, mapping mutliple permissions checks to a single `bulkCheck` call can be useful in some cases.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/bulk-check/data-filtering" />

### Set Timeout

Bulk checking is more performance-intensive than regular checking and also takes more time, which can lead to an OPA timeout.
To address this issue, you can increase the query timeout for the PDP and add more CPU to your virtual machine.

If for example you want a 10 second timeout, you can set the environment variable as follows:

```bash
PDP_OPA_CLIENT_QUERY_TIMEOUT=10
```

For more information on system requirements and performance optimization, you can check [this documentation.](/how-to/deploy/deploy-to-production#system-requirements-and-performance-optimization)

:::note
While `bulkCheck` will save you time in latency, it could have an impact on performance if you're checking permissions for different tenants.
This is because requests are split by tenant in order to reach the relevant PDP instances. This is done in order to ensure compatibility with the current [PDP Sharding](/how-to/manage-data/pdp-sharding) setup, in which an instance might only contain data for a few tenants.
