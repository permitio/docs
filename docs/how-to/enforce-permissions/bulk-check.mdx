To perform bulk permission checks, the `permit.bulkCheck` function can be leveraged.
This allows you to validate multiple permission requests in a single call.

## Usage

The `permit.bulkCheck` function accepts an array of [individual check requests](./check) as input:
```js
const permitted = await permit.bulkCheck([
    ["john@permit.io", "create", "document"],
    ["jane@permit.io", "create", "folder"]
]);
const john_permitted = permitted[0];
const jane_permitted = permitted[1];

if (john_permitted) {
	console.log("John is PERMITTED to create a document");
} else {
	console.log("John is NOT PERMITTED to create a document");
}

if (jane_permitted) {
    console.log("Jane is PERMITTED to create a folder");
} else {
    console.log("Jane is NOT PERMITTED to create a folder");
}
```

:::note

When using [PDP Sharding](/concepts/pdp-sharding), the Bulk Check operation will only work for check requests in the same tenant.
This is because the Bulk Check operation is executed on a single PDP instance,
which has the data for a subset of the tenants in the environment.
