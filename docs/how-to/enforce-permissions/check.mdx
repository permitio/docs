title: Permit.check()
---

`permit.check()` is the main `Authorize` function to enforce permissions in your application.

---

The `permit.check()` function expects the following arguments in its basic form:
* **User** - a user ID `string` or a user `object` representing the user attempting to perform an action.
* **Action** - a `string` representing the action a user is attempting to perform.
* **Resource** - a `string` or `object` representing the target resource. This could refer to a resource type, a specific resource instance (e.g., `document:123`), or an object where `type` specifies the resource type and `key` specifies the resource instance.
* **Context** *(optional)* - a context object that can be used to pass additional data to the policy evaluation.

The `permit.check()` function returns a `boolean` value, indicating whether the user is permitted to perform the action on the resource.

:::tip
To maintain the least code changes in your application, you should carefully choose the most granular `permit.check()` function implementation that fits your use case.
:::

The following examples demonstrate common `permit.check()` usage with a varied level of granularity:

## Basic RBAC Check

The simplest enforcement point you can create using the `permit.check()` function is a Role-based Access Control (RBAC) policy.

To enforce RBAC, `permit.check()` requires three parameters to be passed:

- A unique `userId`
- An `action` this user will attempt to perform
- The `resource` for which we want to manage access to.

:::info
While all examples on this page are written in JavaScript (Node.js SDK), the permit.check() function exists in all Permit SDKs.
:::

```js
const permitted = await permit.check("john@permit.io", "create", "document");

if (permitted) {
  console.log("John is PERMITTED to create a document");
} else {
  console.log("John is NOT PERMITTED to create a document");
}
```

## Tenants

[Tenants](/overview/glossary#tenant) are silos of resources and users.
Tenants can be passed as part of the `resource` object inside the `permit.check()` function.

```js
const permitted = await permit.check("john@permit.io", "create", {
  type: "document",
  tenant: "companyA",
});
```

:::tip Simple example
Say you have two tenants - `Tenant A` and `Tenant B`. The same user can be part of both tenants, with a different role in each one.
I.e., The user can be `admin` in `Tenant A` and `editor` in `Tenant B`.
:::

## Attributes

Sometimes, you might require more granular policies than simple RBAC. That's when Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) comes into play.
Specific user or resource attributes might be required to determine the conditions of when your authorization check should pass.
Each attribute is compared against a pre-defined value. If all of these comparisons pass, the authorization check will be approved. 

Attributes can be declared as part of the `user`, `resource`, or `tenant`. 

:::tip
You can learn more about passing data into Permit [here](/how-to/manage-data/loading-data/)
:::

```js
const permitted = await permit.check(
  // the user object
  {
    // the user key
    key: "john@permit.io",
    // just-in-time attributes on the user
    attributes: {
      location: "England",
      department: "Engineering",
    },
  },
  // the action the user is trying to do
  "create",
  // Resource
  {
    // the type of the resource (the resource key)
    type: "document",
    // just-in-time attributes on the resource
    attributes: {
      hasApproval: "true",
    },
    // the tenant the resource belong to
    tenant: "companyB",
  }
);
```

## Just-In-Time (JIT) Attributes

JIT attributes are a way of passing dynamic values to pre-declared attributes as part of the `permit.check()` function.
Passing JIT attributes is useful when an attribute can match more than a single value. 
There are multiple ways of defining attributes within Permit. You can find a complete guide for them [here](/how-to/manage-data/loading-data). 

:::tipExample
A policy such as:
```
A document can only be accessed by users from EU and UK
```
Would be represented using JIT attributes in the following manner:  
```js
const permitted = await permit.check(
    {
        key: "john@smith.com",
        attributes: {
            location: location, // With location being a variable extracted from your logged user
        },
    },
    "access",
    "document"
);
```
:::

## Relationships

In cases where you want to manage access based on the relationships between identities and resources. That's where Relationship Based Access Control (ReBAC) comes in.

The structure of relationships between identities and resources can be defined via the **[UI](/how-to/build-policies/rebac/building-rebac-policies)** or **[API](/api/rebac/rebac-api-calls)**.

:::tip
In the code example below, we check if `John` has the `assign` permissions on a member group resource (Defined in Permit beforehand).
:::

```javascript
await permit.check(userId, "assign", `member_group:${group}`);
```
import { info } from "autoprefixer"

## Using the Context Object

If you are using custom policy code and need to pass additional data to the policy evaluation, you can use the `context` object.

```js
await permit.check(user, "create", "document", {
  context: {
    // additional data to be passed to the policy evaluation
    totalDocuments: 100,
  },
});
```

## Using the API

While the easiest way to call the `permit.check()` function is to use one of our SDKs, you can also call the Permit PDP directly.
The API endpoint for the `permit.check()` function is `/allowed`.

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-permit-pdp-url>/allowed \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "Authorization: Bearer <your-permit-api-key>" \
  -d '{
    "user": "john@doe.me",
    "action": "create",
    "resource": {
      "type": "document",
      "tenant": "companyA"
    },
    "context": {}
  }'
```


:::info
When calling the `permit.check()` API, ensure that you are calling either your deployed Permit PDP or the Permit cloud PDP. The `api.permit.io` is not supported for the `permit.check()` API.
