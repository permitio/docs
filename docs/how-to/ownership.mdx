Ownership plays an important role in managing and securing access to resources - this guide explains how to setup ownership using Permit

## When Do We Need Ownership?

Ownership becomes crucial in scenarios where control over data, files, or any digital assets is essential to ensure that only authorized individuals or entities can access, modify, or share them.

There are two primary methods that can be employed to model ownership of resources -
Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) and Relationship Based Access Control (ReBAC).
Both approaches offer unique advantages and cater to different requirements for managing access controls.

Let's take a look at a simple example:

:::tipExample
`Bob`, a user in our system, needs to have access to his own files based on his ownership of them.
:::

There are two possible ways to create policies that would enforce `Bob`'s ownership of his files:

:::noteRBAC based Ownership
Technically, it is possible to setup ownership by using roles. Using roles for ownership, we would need to set up access per user and per resource - making it highly inefficient and unscalable.

## ABAC

ABAC utilizes **attributes** as the basis for access control decisions. These attributes can be associated with users, resources, or the environment.
In the context of granting a user access to files based on ownership, ABAC involves adding an `Owner` attribute to each file and folder.
The user is then granted a role that permits them access to any file or folder where the `Owner` attribute matches their ID.

### Pros & Cons

While offering a very granular way of managing ownership on a per-resouce level, ABAC lacks the ability to rely on existing application-level relationships (Such as a file residing within a folder).
This can result in a rather meticulous ownership assignment process only fit for specific scenarios.

### Setting up ABAC based Ownership in Permit

:::tipExample Policy
For the purpose of this example, let's try and setup the following policy:
`Bob` can `Read`, `Upadte`, and `Delete` every file he is an `Owner` of.  
:::

To setup an ABAC based ownership policy in Permit's UI -

1. Login to your Permit account at app.permit.io
2. For the purpose of this tutorial, we setup a resource called `File` and a role called `User` in advance.
3. Go to the `Resources` tab under `Policy`. Locate your resource, and click "Add Attributes".

4. In the resource editor, under `ABAC Options`, click on `Add Attribute`.
   ![Resource Editor](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/2.png)
5. Name the attribute, and set it as a string. Click save.
   ![Add Attribute](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/3.png)
6. Go to the `ABAC Rules` tab, and enable ABAC Options.
7. Create the following ABAC Resource Set:
   ![Resource Set](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/4.png)
8. Go back to the policy editor screen. You should now be able to see a new file-ownership resource set you can manage the permissions for.

The ABAC condition will compare the file_ownership attribute (On the resource) is equal to the `user.key` of the user trying to perform the action.

## ReBAC

ReBAC allows us to implement ownership in a more effective way by leveraging existing application-level relationships and creating simple policies based on hierarchies and groupings.

By creating Parent-Child hierarchies, ReBAC allows us to nest resources under other resources.
Such a relationship allows us to derive roles based on the relationship between two resources:

:::tipExample
![ReBAC Example](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/6.png)
:::

The ReBAC policy for this graph will look like this:

A user who is assigned the role `Folder#Owner` will also be assigned the `File#Owner` when the `Folder` instance is the `Parent` of a `File` instance.

In simpler words, if a file resides inside a folder (That’s the Parent-Child relationship), and a user is assigned the owner of that folder, they will also be the owner of the files.

### Pros & Cons

While providing the obvious benefit of managing hierarchical ownership scenarios, ReBAC might be a little more complex to model.

### Setting up ReBAC based Ownership with Permit

:::tipExample Policy
For the purpose of this example, let's use the same one from before:
`Bob` can `Read`, `Upadte`, and `Delete` every file he is an `Owner` of.  
:::

To setup an ABAC based ownership policy in Permit's UI -

1. Login to your Permit account at app.permit.io
2. For the purpose of this tutorial, we setup a resource called `File`, a resource called `Folder`, and a role called `User` in advance.
3. In the `Policy` section, go to the `Resources` tab. Click on `Add Attributes`.
   ![Resource Editor](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/7.png)
4. Under "ReBAC Options", add a resource role named "owner" to both the `File` and `Folder` resources. In the `Folder` resource, add the following relation:
   ![ReBAC Options](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/8.png)
5. Going back to the `Policy Editor` screen, you will be able to see the `file#owner` role and the `folder#owner` role.
   As `file` is set as parent of `folder`, all permissions set on a `folder` will automatically propogate to `files` within those folders as well.
