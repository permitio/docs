# Custom Rego (OPA) and GitOps

Extend and customize authorization policies with GitOps flows and custom Rego logic.

## Sync policies to Git repositories

Export, version, and manage authorization policies as code: all through CLI commands

### `permit gitops create github`

This command will configure your Permit environment to use the GitOps flow with GitHub. This is useful when you want to manage your policies in your own Git repository and extend them with custom policy code.

**Arguments (Required)**

- `--inactive <boolean>` - set the environment to inactive after configuring GitOps (`default:false`)

**Example:**

```
gitops create github --inactive true
```

---

### `permit gitops env clone`

This clones the environment or the complete project from the active GitOps repository.

**Arguments (Optional)**

- `--api-key <string>` - The API key to select the project. The API Key is of the scope `Project`.
- `--dry-run` - Instead of executing the code, it displays the command to be executed.
- `--project` - Instead of selecting an environment branch to clone, it performs the standard clone operation.

## Extend Predefined Policies with Custom Rego (Open Policy Agent)

Use the CLI to modify and fine-tune Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego policies while maintaining system stability.
