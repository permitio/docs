# Agent Security

Agent Security is a comprehensive permissions layer designed specifically for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It enables organizations to implement fine-grained access control for their AI agents while maintaining security and compliance requirements.

## Core Concepts

Agent Security combines several powerful technologies to deliver a complete permissions solution:

- **Fine-grained ReBAC**: Leverages Permit.io, OPA, and OPAL to implement [relationship-based access control](https://www.permit.io/blog/what-is-rebac)
- **Multi-stage Security**: Implements authentication and authorization that binds user, agent, and MCP server identities
- **Complete Auditing**: Provides comprehensive auditing of every agent action
- **Human Oversight**: Enables human-in-the-loop (HITL) approvals for critical decisions *(coming soon)*

## Getting Started with Documentation

Our documentation is organized to help you understand and implement Agent Security effectively. Here's how to get started:

1. Review the [Overview](/ai-security/mcp-permissions/overview/) to understand the core concepts and fundamental principles
2. Study the [Architecture](/ai-security/mcp-permissions/architecture/) to learn about technical architecture and component interactions
3. Follow the [Getting Started Guide](/ai-security/mcp-permissions/guide/) for practical setup and usage instructions
