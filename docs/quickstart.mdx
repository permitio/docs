Welcome to Permit! In this quick tutorial, we will go over the basic steps of setting up your account with Permit and creating
a very basic authorization policy. Letâ€™s get started!

:::tipA Video Walkthrough
If you prefer to start with a video, this video will introduce you to the fundamental features within the Permit system with a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities.

## 1. Create a Permit account

The first step is creating an account. This account will be used to configure and manage the authorization layer of your application.

:::note Social Logins and SSO
You can log into Permit with your Google / GitHub account.
Permit also offers Single Sign-On (SSO) login functionality, allowing users to access their accounts using enterprise credentials.
SSO is provided as the default option in [Permitâ€™s Enterprise Tier](http://permit.io/pricing), or as a standalone option at a yearly
defined rate.

To get a custom quote on SSO, reach out to us via our **[Slack Community](https://io.permit.io/docs-to-slack)**.

## 2. Creating a workspace & naming your organization

First, you will need to create your workspace (Or, organizational account), under which all of your configurations,
projects, and environments reside. This will often correspond with your companyâ€™s name.

:::tip Example:
We have a company called "Company A" - this is our business, so that's what we will call our organization
:::

:::note
You can have multiple workspaces and switch between them - although usually, you'd only need one. Workspaces are completely
siloed from one another.
:::

Thatâ€™s it! You can now launch your account! ðŸ¥³ Now that you have all the basics set up, you can connect Permit to a demo application and see your
defined policy come to life.

## 3. Creating a basic policy

Once we register with Permit and set-up our organization, now it's time to configure out first simple policy. We will be working with the
simplest policy model called RBAC (Role-based Access Control).

The idea of this simple guide is to show you how you create your first role, add a resource, and actions to that resource, and then
assign the role to a user.

### Creating a role

The first step is to create a role for each user. In this example, we will create a role called `Admin`.

<video controls autoPlay loop>
  <source src={createRole} />
</video>

### Creating a resource and actions

Once we created our role, the next step is to create a resource, and actions that we can perform on that resource. In this example
we create a resource called a `Document` and utilize the basic pre-defined actions Permit provides (`crate`, `read`, `update` and `delete`),
as well as assign our own bespoke actions: `publish`.

<video controls autoPlay loop>
  <source src={createResource} />
</video>

### Creating a user

Now that we have a role, resource and some actions, we need to add a user into Permit, and assign him the role we have created.

Let's add a user called `sam@permit.io` and assign him the role of an `Admin`.

<video controls autoPlay loop>
  <source src={createUser} />
</video>

### Configuring permissions in the Policy editor

Finally, we need to configure our permissions in the Policy Editor, defining what actions `Admin` role can perform on the `Document`
resource.

<video controls autoPlay loop>
  <source src={checkPolicies} />
</video>

:::note A Quick Note!
Permit is **much more than this simple RBAC example!** With our no-code UI and Policy Editor, you are able to create much more granular
permissions. Policy models such as **ABAC (Attribute-based Access Control)** and **ReBAC (Relationship-based Access Control)**, or even
the combination of them both is now really easy to configure.
