## Add the SDK to your JS code

Initialise the **Node.js SDK** and check for permissions.

1. Install the Permit.io SDK

```
npm install permitio
```

2. Import the SDK into your code

<Tabs groupId="jsimport">
<TabItem value="import" label="Import" default>

```js
import { Permit } from "permitio";
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="require" label="Require">

```js
const { Permit } = require("permitio");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. Create a new instance of the SDK. <br/>
   You can find instructions on getting a secret API key in the previous section.

```js
// This line initializes the SDK and connects your Node.js app
// to the Permit.io PDP container you've set up in the previous step.
const permit = new Permit({
  // your API Key
  token: "[YOUR_API_KEY]",
  // in production, you might need to change this url to fit your deployment
  pdp: "http://localhost:7766",
  // if you want the SDK to emit logs, uncomment this:
  // log: {
  //   level: "debug",
  // },
  // The SDK returns false if you get a timeout / network error
  // if you want it to throw an error instead, and let you handle this, uncomment this:
  // throwOnError: true,
});
```

## Check for permissions using the SDK

You can run a permission check with `permit.check()`, passing in 3 arguments:

- `user`: a unique string id that identifies the user doing the action. This is typically the user key.
- `action`: the action performed.
- `resource`: the resource (object) the action is performed on.

In the following example we are checking that a user with the unique id `john@smith.com` can `create` a `document` resource.

```js
const permitted = await permit.check("john@permit.io", "create", "document");
if (permitted) {
  console.log("John is PERMITTED to create a document");
} else {
  console.log("John is NOT PERMITTED to create a document");
}
```

:::info
Usually instead of an email you'd use the unique identifier provided by your chosen authentication solution.
You can also pass the entire decoded JWT, to include attributes about the user.
:::

:::tip REMEMBER

In cases where you are dealing with more than one tenant in your application, `permit.check()` can pass the **tenant** as part of the **resource**.

The tenant passed in needs to be either the **tenant id** or the **tenant key**.

You can use the **[list_tenants API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Tenants/operation/list_tenants)** to **get the ids and keys set for your tenants**.

`tenant`: a unique tenant id or tenant key that you have defined within Permit.

:::

For example, if we want to check if `john@permit.io` can read documents that belong to the `awesome_inc` tenant:

```js
const permitted = await permit.check(
  // the key of the user
  "john@permit.io",
  // the action
  "read",
  {
    type: "document",
    tenant: "awesome_inc",
  }
);
```

## Check permissions against ABAC policies

Above we have checked for permissions against an RBAC policy - but what if we have an **ABAC policy** we want to run a permission check for?
An ABAC policy is made up of **User Sets** and **Resource Sets**, which you can read more about [here](/how-to/build-policies/abac/components#subject--subject-attributes).

With ABAC we define conditions based on **pre-configured attributes**.

If we are running a `permit.check()` for an ABAC policy, we can attach **just-in-time attributes** to the `user` and the `resource`.
There attributes are merged (and override) user and resource attributes that were persisted to the permit API.

```js
const permitted = await permit.check(
  // the user object
  {
    // the user key
    key: "check@permit.io",
    // just-in-time attributes on the user
    attributes: {
      location: "England",
      department: "Engineering",
    },
  },
  // the action the user is trying to do
  "action",
  // Resource
  {
    // the type of the resource (the resource key)
    type: "resource",
    // just-in-time attributes on the resource
    attributes: {
      hasApproval: "true",
    },
    // the tenant the resource belong to
    tenant: "tenant",
  }
);
```

:::note REMEMBER

Permission checks are being run against the PDP container that's running locally on your machine - offering
minimal latency and without leaving your network.

This means that your user data **never** goes outside your system, **keeping security high**.

## Full app example

Assuming a Node.js app made up of a single file, with the `permitio` and `express` modules installed.

```js
const { Permit } = require("permitio");

const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 4000;

// This line initializes the SDK and connects your Node.js app
// to the Permit.io PDP container you've set up in the previous step.
const permit = new Permit({
  // in production, you might need to change this url to fit your deployment
  pdp: "http://localhost:7766",
  // your secret API Key
  token: "[YOUR_API_KEY]",
});

// You can open http://localhost:4000 to invoke this http
// endpoint, and see the outcome of the permission check.
app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  // Example user object
  // You would usually get the user from your authentication layer (e.g. Auth0, Cognito, etc) via a JWT token or a database.
  const user = {
    key: "[A_USER_ID]",
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Smith",
    email: "john@permit.io",
  };

  // check for permissions to a resource and action (in this example, create a document)
  const permitted = await permit.check(user.key, "create", "document");
  if (permitted) {
    res.status(200).send(`${user.firstName} ${user.lastName} is PERMITTED to create document!`);
  } else {
    res.status(403).send(`${user.firstName} ${user.lastName} is NOT PERMITTED to create document!`);
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
