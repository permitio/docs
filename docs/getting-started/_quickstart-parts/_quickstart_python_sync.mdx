## Add the SDK to your Python code

Initialise the **Python SDK** and check for permissions.

1. Install the Permit.io SDK:

```
pip install permit
```

2. Import the SDK into your code. <br/>
   Notice that you need to import the class `Permit` from `permit.sync` to get the sync-python SDK.

```python
from permit.sync import Permit
```

3. Create a new instance of the SDK. <br/>
   You can find instructions on getting a secret API key in the previous section.

```python
# This line initializes the SDK and connects your python app
# to the Permit.io PDP container you've set up.
permit = Permit(
    # in production, you might need to change this url to fit your deployment
    pdp="http://localhost:7766",
    # your secret API KEY
    token="<your-api-key>",
)
```

## Check for permissions using the SDK

You can run a permission check with `permit.check()`, passing in 3 arguments:

- `user_id`: a unique string id that identifies the user doing the action.
- `action`: the action performed.
- `resource`: the resource (object) the action is performed on.

In the following example we are checking that a user with the unique id `john@smith.com` can `create` a `document` resource.

```python
permitted = await permit.check("john@smith.com", "create", "document")

if permitted:
    print("John is permitted to create a document")
else:
    print("John is NOT PERMITTED to create document!")
```

:::info
Usually instead of an email you'd use the unique identifier provided by your chosen authentication solution.
You can also pass the entire decoded JWT, to include attributes about the user.
:::

:::tip REMEMBER

In cases where you are dealing with more than one tenant in your application, `permit.check()` can pass the **tenant** as part of the **resource**.

The tenant passed in needs to be either the **tenant id** or the **tenant key**.

You can use the **[list_tenants API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Tenants/operation/list_tenants)** to **get the ids and keys set for your tenants**.

`tenant`: a unique tenant id or tenant key that you have defined within Permit.

:::

```python
permitted = await permit.check("userId", "action", { type: "resource", tenant: "tenant" })
```

## Check permissions against ABAC policies

Above we have checked for permissions against an RBAC policy - but what if we have an **ABAC policy** we want to run a permission check for?
An ABAC policy is made up of **User Sets** and **Resource Sets**, which you can read more about [here](/how-to/build-policies/abac/components#subject--subject-attributes).

With ABAC we define conditions based on **pre-configured attributes**.

If we are running a `permit.check()` for an ABAC policy, we replace the `userId` and the `resource` with objects, containing attributes.

```python
permitted = await permit.check(
	# User Set
	{
		"userId": "check@permit.io",
		"attributes": {
			"location": "England",
			"department": "Engineering",
		},
	},
	# Action
	"action",
	# Resource Set
	{
		"type": "resource",
		"attributes": {
			"hasApproval": "true",
		},
		"tenant": "tenant",
	}
)
```

:::note REMEMBER

Permission checks are being run against the PDP container that's running locally on your machine - offering
minimal latency and without leaving your network.

This means that your user data **never** goes outside your system, **keeping security high**.

:::

<!-- ## Write API

Running `permit.write()` will perform API calls against the Permit cloud and will modify
the state of permissions and other objects in the system.

### Sync user (create a user in the permissions system)

Before being able to check permissions with `permit.check()` -
Permit must be able to identify the user and attach permissions and roles to that user.
In order to declare a new user in the system, use `permit.api.sync_user()`:

```python
user = {
    "key": "john@smith.com", # can be any unique string
    "firstName": "John", # optional
    "lastName": "Smith", # optional
    "email": "john@smith.com", # optional
}
permit.api.users.create(user)
```

### Sync user with initial roles

If you want to **attach** a role to a user in the same API call you can define _initial_ roles by adding a **role key**.
Each item in the _initial_ role list will include a role key (the role name) and a tenant key.

```python
user = {
    "key": "john@smith.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "email": "john@smith.com",
    # John will be assigned the admin role in the default tenant upon creation
    "roles": [{"role":"admin", "tenant": "default"}]
}
permit.api.users.create(user)
```

:::note
If a user with such key already **exists** in Permit, **we will not override** the user roles and Permit will **ignore** the role key completely.
:::

### Create a tenant

Tenants represent user and resource boundaries in your system. Typically if you are building
a multi tenant SaaS application where you are serving multiple customers from the same software
instances, _tenants_ allow you to create a **boundary** around one customer (i.e: tenant) such that users outside
the tenant cannot access the tenant's associated resources.

Every one of your customers is typically a tenant that contains only that tenant's users.

To create a tenant, use `permit.api.tenants.create()`:

```python
cool_company_tenant = {
    "key": "cool_company_inc",
    "name": "Cool Company Inc"
}

permit.write(permit.api.create_tenant(cool_company_tenant))
```

### Assign a role

You can assign a role to a user in a given tenant:

```python
permit.write(
    permit.api.users.assign_role("john@smith.com", "viewer", "cool_company_inc")
)
```

### Chaining multiple mutations together

You can chain multiple write operations (**_or mutations_**), and `permit.write()`
will run them according to the order you specify.

```python
# runs the mutations in order:
# first creates the user "john"
permit.api.users.create(
    {
        "key": "john@smith.com",
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Smith",
        "email": "john@smith.com",
    }
),
# then, creates the "cool_company_inc" tenant
permit.api.tenants.create({"key": "cool_company_inc", "name": "Cool Company Inc"}),
# finally, assigns the role "admin" to user "john" on the tenant "cool_company_inc"
permit.api.users.assign_role("john@smith.com", "admin", "cool_company_inc")

``` -->

## Full app example

Assuming a Python app made up of a single file, with the `permit` and `FastAPI` modules installed.

Create a new directory for your new python project.

```
mkdir hello-permissions && cd hello-permissions
```

Optionally, create a new virtual environment for your project - you might need to install `pyenv` and `virtualenv`.

```
pyenv virtualenv permissions && pyenv activate permissions
```

Now install the Permit.io SDK. We will also install `flask` package.

```
pip install permit flask
```

Create a file called `test.py`.

```
touch test.py
```

Copy the following code inside `test.py` and replace with your `API KEY` and `user-object`.
You can find instructions on getting a secret API Key in the previous section.

```python
import json

from permit.sync import Permit

from flask import Flask, Response

app = Flask(__name__)

# This line initializes the SDK and connects your python app
# to the Permit.io PDP container you've set up in the previous step.
permit = Permit(
    # in production, you might need to change this url to fit your deployment
    pdp="http://localhost:7766",
    # your API KEY
    token="[YOUR_API_KEY]",
)

def sync_objects():
    # first let's create a user:
    user = {
        "key": "john3@smith.com",
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Smith",
        "email": "john@smith.com",
        "role_assignments": [{"role":"admin", "tenant": "default"}]
    }
    permit.api.users.create(user)
    tenant2 = {
        "key": "tenant2",
        "name": "Second Tenant"
    }

    # create tenant 2 and assign role viewer to user john
    permit.api.roles.create(
        permit.api.create_tenant(tenant2),
        permit.api.assign_role("john@smith.com", "viewer", "tenant2")
    )

# sync_objects()

@app.route("/")
def check_permissions():
    # After we created this user in the previous step, we also synced the user's identifier
    # to permit.io servers with permit.api.users.create(user). The user identifier
    # can be anything (email, db id, etc.) but must be unique for each user. Now that the
    # user is synced, we can use its identifier to check permissions with `permit.check()`.
    permitted = permit.check("john@smith.com", "retrieve", "task") # default tenant is used
    if not permitted:
        return Response(json.dumps({
            "result": f"John Smith is NOT PERMITTED to retrieve task!"
        }), status=403, mimetype='application/json')

    return Response(json.dumps({
            "result": f"John Smith is PERMITTED to retrieve task!"
        }), status=200, mimetype='application/json')

@app.route("/tenant2")
def check_permissions_tenant2():
    # After we created this user in the previous step, we also synced the user's identifier
    # to permit.io servers with permit.api.users.create(user). The user identifier
    # can be anything (email, db id, etc.) but must be unique for each user. Now that the
    # user is synced, we can use its identifier to check permissions with `permit.check()`.
    permitted = permit.check("john@smith.com", "create", {"type": "task", "tenant": "tenant2"}) # tenant2 is used
    if not permitted:
        return Response(json.dumps({
            "result": f"John Smith is NOT PERMITTED to create task (tenant 2)!"
        }), status=403, mimetype='application/json')

    return Response(json.dumps({
            "result": f"John Smith is PERMITTED to create task (tenant 2)!"
        }), status=200, mimetype='application/json')


```

Now that your application is ready, let's run it!

```
FLASK_APP=test flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```

Finally, go to your applications localhost live deployment to see the outcome of the permission check.
