## Add the SDK to your Golang code

Initialise the **Golang SDK** and check for permissions.

1. Install the Permit.io SDK for Golang

```bash
go get github.com/permitio/permit-golang
```

2. Import the SDK into your code

```go
import "github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/permit"
```

3. Create a new instance of the SDK. <br/>
   You can find instructions on getting a secret API key in the previous section.

```go
package main

import "github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/permit"
import "github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/config"

func main() {
	PermitConfig := config.NewConfigBuilder("<YOUR_API_TOKEN>").Build()
	Permit := permit.New(PermitConfig)
}
```

## Check for permissions using the SDK

You can run a permission check with `permit.check()`. You need to pass 3 arguments to the function:

- `User`: a unique user that identifies the user doing the action - this can be created using `models.NewUserCreate("user_key")`
- `action`: the action performed, as string.
- `resource`: the resource the action is performed on - this can be created using `models.NewResourceCreate("resource_key")`

In the following example we are checking that a user with the unique id `john@permit.io` can `create` a `document` resource.

```go
package main

import "github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/permit"
import "github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/config"
import "github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/enforcement"

func main() {
	PermitConfig := config.NewConfigBuilder("<YOUR_API_TOKEN>").Build()
	Permit := permit.New(PermitConfig)

	user := enforcement.UserBuilder("john@doe.com").Build()
	resource := enforcement.ResourceBuilder("document").Build()
	permitted, err := Permit.Check(user, "create", resource)
	if err != nil {
		return
	}
	if permitted {
		// Let the user read the resource
	} else {
		// Deny access
	}
}
```

:::info
Usually instead of an email you'd use the unique identifier provided by your chosen authentication solution.
You can also pass the entire decoded JWT, to include attributes about the user.
:::

:::tip REMEMBER

In cases where you are dealing with more than one tenant in your application, `Permit.Check()` can pass the **tenant** as part of the **resource**.

The tenant passed in needs to be either the **tenant id** or the **tenant key**.

You can use the **[list_tenants API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Tenants/operation/list_tenants)** to **get the ids and keys set for your tenants**.

`tenant`: a unique tenant id or tenant key that you have defined within Permit.

:::

```go
	resource := enforcement.ResourceBuilder("document").WithTenant("tenant").Build()
    const permitted = await permit.check(user, "create", resource);
```

## Check permissions against ABAC policies

Above we have checked for permissions against an RBAC policy - but what if we have an **ABAC policy** we want to run a permission check for?
An ABAC policy is made up of **User Sets** and **Resource Sets**, which you can read more about [here](/how-to/build-policies/abac/components/#what-makes-up-an-abac-policy).

With ABAC we define conditions based on **pre-configured attributes**.

If we are running a `permit.check()` for an ABAC policy, we replace the `userId` and the `resource` with objects, containing attributes.

```go
userCheck := enforcement.UserBuilder("userKey").Build()
attributes := map[string]string{
	"hasApproval": "true",
}
resourceCheck := enforcement.ResourceBuilder("resourceKey").WithTenant("default").WithAttributes(attributes).Build()
allowed, _ := permitClient.Check(userCheck, "create", resourceCheck)
```

:::note REMEMBER

Permission checks are being run against the PDP container that's running locally on your machine - offering
minimal latency and without leaving your network.

This means that your user data **never** goes outside your system, **keeping security high**.

## Full app example

Assuming a Node.js app made up of a single file, with the `permitio` and `express` modules installed.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"go.uber.org/zap"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/config"
	"github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/enforcement"
	"github.com/permitio/permit-golang/pkg/permit"
)

const (
	port = 4000
)

func main() {
	// This line initializes the SDK and connects your Go app
	// to the Permit.io PDP container (you've set in the previous step), with the API key provided.
	permitClient := permit.NewPermit(
		// Building new config for Permit client
		config.NewConfigBuilder(
			// your api key
			"<YOUR_API_KEY>").
			// Set the PDP URL
			WithLogger(zap.NewExample()).
			WithPdpUrl("http://localhost:7766").
			Build(),
	)

	// You can open http://localhost:4000 to invoke this http
	// endpoint, and see the outcome of the permission check.
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// This user was defined by you in the previous step and
		// is already assigned with a role in the permission system.
		user := enforcement.UserBuilder("user_id").
			WithFirstName("john").
			WithLastName("doe").
			WithEmail("jown@doe.com").
			Build()

		// This resource was defined by you in the previous step
		// and is already has actions assigned in the permission system.
		resource := enforcement.ResourceBuilder("document").Build()

		// After we created this user in the previous step, we also synced the user's identifier
		// to permit.io servers with permitClient.syncUser(user)).
		// The user identifier can be anything (email, db id, etc) but must be unique for each user.
		// Now that the user is synced, we can use its identifier to check permissions with `permit.check()`.
		permitted, err := permitClient.Check(user, "read", resource)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
			return
		}
		if permitted {
			w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
			_, err = w.Write([]byte(user.FirstName + " " + user.LastName + " is PERMITTED to read document!"))
		} else {
			w.WriteHeader(http.StatusForbidden)
			_, err = w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(user.FirstName + " " + user.LastName + " is NOT PERMITTED to read document!")))
		}
	})
	fmt.Printf("Listening on http://localhost:%d", port)
	http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(":%d", port), nil)
}
```
