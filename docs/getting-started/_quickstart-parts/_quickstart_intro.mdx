:::note Prerequisites:
This tutorial is intended for users who have completed the basic setup of at least one policy in Permit.
If you haven’t done that yet, [check out this guide first](/getting-started/quickstart).
:::

## 1. Get your Permit Environment API Key

- In the [Permit Dashboard](https://app.permit.io/), navigate to the Projects screen.
- Find the [Project](/overview/glossary#project) and [Environment](/overview/glossary#environment) you wish to connect to.
- Click the ![Dots](/ui-videos/getting-started/connecting-your-app/dots.png) icon on the top right of the environment card.
- Click Copy API Key.

:::note
You can also copy the Environment API Key of the active environment by clicking on the **User Menu > Copy API Key**

:::

:::info Remember
The API Key that you will copy from the user menu is linked to the active environment on the sidebar.
Switching to another active environment and then clicking on the **Copy SDK API Key** option will copy a **different** API Key - the API key of the newly activated environment.

## 2. Setup your PDP (Policy Decision Point) Container

Permit provides you with a [Policy Decision Point](overview/how-does-it-work#the-policy-decision-point-pdp),
which functions as your microservice for authorization. The PDP is provided as a docker container ready for you to use,
or as a cloud version for quick experimentation.

<Tabs groupId="pdp">
<TabItem value="cloud" label="Cloud PDP" default>

It is extremely simple to utilize the cloud PDP. As part of the initialization of the Permit instance, you need to pass
the cloud PDP URL.

:::note
The cloud PDP is great for quick experimentation with Permit, to learn how the service works, and to quickly integrate the SDK.

In production deployments, it is best to deploy the Docker Container PDP for better latency and availability.

**For time being, the cloud PDP does not support ABAC and ReBAC**
As the cloud PDP is not compatible with Attribute-based Access Control policies
:::

```js
// This line initializes the SDK and connects your app
// to the Permit.io Cloud PDP.

const permit = new Permit({
  pdp: "https://cloudpdp.api.permit.io",
  // your API Key
  token: "[YOUR_API_KEY]",
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="container" label="Container PDP">

Please follow the steps below to **install** and **run** the container on your local machine.

### 1. Pull our PDP container from Docker Hub

If you do not have Docker installed as of yet, **[click here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** to install Docker.

```
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

### 2. Run the container

Remember to **replace** `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the **Secret Key** you obtained in the previous step.

```
docker run -it -p 7766:7000 --env PDP_DEBUG=True --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

:::info
Congratulations! You should now have a PDP container running. You can always check the status of the container
by typing `docker ps` in your terminal.

Let's add the Permit SDK to **[your app](/getting-started/quickstart)** or use the demo example below.
