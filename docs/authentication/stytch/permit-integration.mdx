title: Stytch & Permit Integration
---

Stytch is one of the leading authentication platforms for developers, offering robust and scalable authentication solutions.
Permit.io is a leading authorization platform, providing easily manageable and secure authorization capabilities. By integrating
Stytch with Permit.io, you can enhance your application with both strong authentication and dynamic authorization.

In this guide, you'll learn how to add Stytch-powered authentication to application using their **frontend JavaScript SDK**
and their **backend Node SDK**, along with their pre-built login UI component.

---

:::note
There are many different ways to implement Stytch, and the specific strategy you choose will depend on your use case and preferences.
This guide is intended to demonstrate one way of implementing Stytch in order to get you up and running as quickly as possible.

We will base our examples on working with a Next.js application. However, Stytch provides example applications in **various programming
languages** to suit different development needs.

## What you will build

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to integrate Stytch for secure authentication and Permit.io for easily manageable authorization,
allowing us to change our application's permissions on the fly.

:::note
This guide provides a basic introduction to integrating Stytch with Permit.io for authentication and authorization.
**The authorization functionality demonstrated will be quite simple.**
:::

## Prerequisites

- Stytch account with a Stytch Consumer project via the Stytch Dashboard. You can read more about doing
  so [here](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/quickstarts/nextjs#before-you-start).
- Permit account
- Basic understanding of Next.js App Router

## Stytch Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install Stytch SDKs and Configure Your API Keys

First, add our frontend JavaScript SDK and backend Node SDK packages to your Next.js application:

```bash
npm install @stytch/nextjs @stytch/vanilla-js stytch --save
```

Next, add your Stytch project's API keys to your application as environment variables:

```
STYTCH_PROJECT_ENV=test
STYTCH_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_STYTCH_PROJECT_ID"
STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN="YOUR_STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN"
STYTCH_SECRET="YOUR_STYTCH_SECRET"
```

### Step 2: Wrap Your Application in a StytchProvider

Initialize the Stytch client and add a StytchProvider component to the root of your application so that the frontend JavaScript
SDK is available to child components:

```javascript
import { StytchProvider, createStytchUIClient } from "@stytch/nextjs";
import Head from "next/head";

const stytch = createStytchUIClient(process.env.STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN);

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>{/* Truncated */}</Head>
      <StytchProvider stytch={stytch}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </StytchProvider>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Add a StytchLogin Component

Create a StytchLogin component. You can configure which authentication methods you'd like to offer by modifying the products array
in your config object. Here's an example that includes Email Magic Links and OAuth products:

```javascript
import { StytchLogin, Products } from "@stytch/vanilla-js";

const Login = () => {
  const REDIRECT_URL = "SEE_STEP_5";

  const config = {
    products: [Products.emailMagicLinks, Products.oauth],
    emailMagicLinksOptions: {
      loginRedirectURL: REDIRECT_URL,
      loginExpirationMinutes: 60,
      signupRedirectURL: REDIRECT_URL,
      signupExpirationMinutes: 60,
    },
    oauthOptions: {
      providers: [{ type: "google" }],
      loginRedirectURL: REDIRECT_URL,
      signupRedirectURL: REDIRECT_URL,
    },
  };

  return <StytchLogin config={config} styles={{}} />;
};
```

Next, add the StytchLogin component to your application's login page. You'll notice that we check for a logged-in user
before displaying the StytchLogin component:

```javascript
import { useStytchUser } from "@stytch/nextjs";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function LoginPage() {
  const { user, isInitialized } = useStytchUser();
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isInitialized && user) {
      router.replace("/profile");
    }
  }, [user, isInitialized, router]);

  return <Login />;
}
```

### Step 4: Handle Redirects and Complete the Authentication Flow

In this step we want to make sure that as a user is successfully logged in, we redirect him to the initial page of the app, in this case
the `/profile`.

#### Specifying the Redirect URL

- **Define the Redirect URL:** Set the `REDIRECT_URL` parameter in your StytchLogin component configuration.
- **Update Stytch Dashboard:** Add the redirect URL to the Redirect URLs tab in the Stytch Dashboard.

#### Create the Redirect Page Component

Start by importing the necessary modules and then creating the redirect component:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import stytch from "stytch";

export default function RedirectPage() {
  const router = useRouter();

 ...

}
```

### Use useEffect to handle authentication

We only want to redirect id we made sure that we have a successful user session.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const stytch_token_type = router?.query?.stytch_token_type?.toString();
  const token = router?.query?.token?.toString();

  if (token && stytch_token_type === "oauth") {
    stytch.oauth.authenticate(token, {
      session_duration_minutes: 60,
    });
  } else if (token && stytch_token_type === "magic_links") {
    stytch.magicLinks.authenticate(token, {
      session_duration_minutes: 60,
    });
  }
}, [router]);

return <div>Loading...</div>;
```

The whole code for this step is as showcased below:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import stytch from "stytch";

export default function RedirectPage() {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    const stytch_token_type = router?.query?.stytch_token_type?.toString();
    const token = router?.query?.token?.toString();

    if (token && stytch_token_type === "oauth") {
      stytch.oauth.authenticate(token, {
        session_duration_minutes: 60,
      });
    } else if (token && stytch_token_type === "magic_links") {
      stytch.magicLinks.authenticate(token, {
        session_duration_minutes: 60,
      });
    }
  }, [router]);

  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```

### Step 5: Grant Access to Protected Frontend Content

As you successfully implement the above steps into your custom application, you should be able to use Stytch to perform a user login.
Stytch's frontend JavaScript SDK will automatically populate the session and user objects. Use the `useStytchSession` and
`useStytchUser` hooks to listen for changes:

```javascript
import { useStytchUser, useStytchSession } from "@stytch/nextjs";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export default function ProfilePage() {
  const { user, isInitialized } = useStytchUser();
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isInitialized && !user) {
      router.replace("/");
    }
  }, [user, isInitialized, router]);

  return <div>Profile Page Content</div>;
}
```

### Step 6: Grant Access to Protected Server-side Routes

The below code will allow you to work with Stytch's backend Node SDK, which will retrieve the Stytch `session_token` or `session_jwt`
from the request cookies, and then call the `sessions.authenticate` or `sessions.authenticateJwt` methods:

```javascript
import stytch from "stytch";

let client;

const loadStytch = () => {
  if (!client) {
    client = new stytch.Client({
      project_id: process.env.STYTCH_PROJECT_ID || "",
      secret: process.env.STYTCH_SECRET || "",
      env: process.env.STYTCH_PROJECT_ENV === "live" ? stytch.envs.live : stytch.envs.test,
    });
  }
  return client;
};

export async function getServerSideProps({ req }) {
  const redirectRes = {
    redirect: {
      destination: "/",
      permanent: false,
    },
  };

  const sessionJWT = req.cookies["stytch_session_jwt"];

  if (!sessionJWT) {
    return redirectRes;
  }

  const stytchClient = loadStytch();

  try {
    await stytchClient.sessions.authenticateJwt(sessionJWT);
    return { props: {} };
  } catch (e) {
    return redirectRes;
  }
}
```

As you saw in the above step, we are fetching a `sessionJWT` directly from the cookies. As we are also able to authenticate the session
with the `.authenticateJwt()` function, we therefore know the `user id` will also be available to us, so we can proceed to sync the user
into Permit. This is part of the **handoff point** implementation.

:::tip WHY DO WE SYNC USERS?
We need to sync user identities into Permit to understand each user's assigned role. This allows us to immediately identify their
role upon successful authentication, enabling us to apply the appropriate policies and rules. As a result, we can clearly define
what each user is permitted or restricted from doing.
:::

Before we move to utilize the syncUser function, we need to do a basic Permit setup in the UI.

## Permit Pre-sync setup guide

For the initial setup guide with Permit, please follow the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart). It will give you an outline how to
create a basic `workspace` with permit, create roles, resources, and assign permissions to the roles.

Below is an example of the policy we will be working with. The only thing we are missing is syncing a user into Permit, and assigning
them the appropriate role.

![Basic Policy](/ui-videos/authentication/stytch/account-owner-role.png)

### Importing and initializing the Permit object

As you work with your app's implementation, any critical, data sensitive actions are performed in the backend. Inside of your backend
file, you need to import the Permit package and initialize the Permit instance object.

```javascript
import { Permit } from "permitio";

const permit = new Permit({
  // The Environment API Key
  token: process.env.PERMIT_API_KEY,
  // The URL for the deployed PDP. Usually runs on port 7766.
  pdp: process.env.PERMIT_PDP_HOSTNAME,
});
```

### Creating a handoff-point check

Once the session is created, we need to immediately fetch the userId and add the user to Permit, before we show the end-user any of
our UI.

#### Fetching the stytch `userId`

```javascript
const { user } = useStytchUser();

const userId = user.user_id;
```

#### Performing the authentication check

```javascript
const isAutenticated = await stytchClient.sessions.authenticateJwt(sessionJWT);
if (isAutenticated) {
  // perform all SDK function calls here, passing in the userId.
}
```

As part of user synchronization, we use 3 functions from the SDK:

1. Creating a new Tenant
2. Adding a user to the new Tenant
3. Assigning the user with a new Role

Let's break it down to each individual function:

### Creating a new Tenant

```javascript
await permit.api.tenants.create({
  key: userEmailId,
  name: userEmail,
});
```

### Adding a user to the Tenant

```javascript
await permit.api.syncUser({
  key: userId,
  email: userEmail,
});
```

### Assigning a role to the user

Here we are assigning a role of Account Owner, using the role key `AccountOwner`.

```javascript
await permit.api.assignRole({
  role: "AccountOwner",
  tenant: tenantId,
  user: userId,
});
```

Once these SDK calls are complete, we will see a user created inside of a new tenant, and assigned a new role.

![Basic Policy](/ui-videos/authentication/stytch/user-synced.png)

### Wrapping-up

You are all done! You have successfully set-up Stytch as your authentication solution, and combined it with Permit
to enforce your authorization by syncing these users into Permit and assigning them a role.

Now you are ready to enforce different parts of your application level code. As an example, we have created a simple enforcement below
that checks if the `AccountOwner` has the ability to `view all the information for his account`.

```javascript
const isPermitted = await permit.check(id, "view-all", {
  type: "Account",
  tenant: currentTenant,
});
```

If we look back into the Policy Editor, and the `Account Owner` role, we can see that for the `Current Account` we have the ability to
`view-all` as it has been checked.
