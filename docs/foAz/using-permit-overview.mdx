The current interface experience are likely to change im the near future. This feature is still in early access.

## Setting it up

1. To find detailed instructions on how to fetch the JWKS, refer to the corresponding guide provided by your authentication provider.
   You can find a summary for the mosty popular authentication porvider [here](/foaz/fetching-jwks).

2. [Configure](/foaz/configuring-jwks) your JWKS with Permit, so it will be able to verify your user JWTs for you.

3. Configure the Protected API call with Permit, and set a secret for it. This makes sure Permit will only call
   APIs you defined.

4. Map the API call to a resource / action, so you can use the policy-editor to define permissions for it.
   This makes sure Permit will only call API when you allow them.

## Login your frontend user with Permit

Permit.io's Frontend SDK provides a [login method](/features/permit-elements/element/user-management#client-side-login-method)
to which you pass your user's JWT.

## Calling an API via Permit

After the login, we can now invoke the Permit SDK with an [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) like interface.

See an example below using Twilio with basic HTTP authentication.

:::note
Bearer Token, and Cookie authentication are similarly supported.
:::

```javascript
// Send an SMS with Twilio via a Permit FoAz protected API call
// `{{}}` used to template and render secrets into the call at the secure proxy
permit.proxy.post(
        'https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{{accountSID}}/Messages.json?Body=hello&To=555&From=1337',
        // Templates to be loaded with actual secrets at proxy.permit.io prior to the actual call to Twilio
        auth: {
            username: "{{accountSID}}"
            password: "{{twilioAuthToken}}"
        }
}).then((res) => {
        console.log(res, 'res');
}).catch((err) => {
        console.log(err);
});
```
