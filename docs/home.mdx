## Feature flags made easy, fast, and painless.

Optoggles is an Open Source project that was built to take the pain from building and maintaining feature flags.

For frontened developers, there's no change in their experience from another feature flag solution.<br/>
For backend developers, there's little amount of work and the feature flags are automatically created and kept up-to-date in real time.

Optoggles is built on top of OPA and OPAL:

It uses OPA as the source of truth for what features users authorized to see.
It uses OPAL to get real-time policy/data updates.

OPToggles is working with launchdarkly.com and with a Generic REST API

## What is OPA?

[OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org), which stands for Open Policy Agent, was built by Styra for cloud-native applications. <br/>

The agent has its policy written in Rego, and you can learn more about it in [OPA docs](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#rego).
Rego has also a plaground you can find [here](https://play.openpolicyagent.org/).<br/>

OPA supports a range of policies, including high-performance policy decisions that have 1-millisecond latency, and policies that require searching, indexing, etc.

## Why OPA is not enough?

OPA is not built for policies that rely on data that can change in real-time.

In some cases, your policy requires real-time data updates from a third-party vendor to decide if the user can access a specific feature.

In example, if you have a feature for paying users only, you will need to access a payment provider, i.e. Paypal or Stripe, and check for the user's status.
The feature flag must be updated in real time as soon as the user changes their subscription status.
If the user unsubscribed from his mobile app, we want the web to be updated immediately.
This is where OPAL comes into play.

## What is OPAL?

OPAL or Open Policy Administration Layer is an open-source project that keeps your policy agent up to date in real-time, both your policy and your data. It is divided into OPAL server and OPAL clients, each has a specific role.

OPAL server keeps your policy updated by tracking your git repository for policy updates. 
As soon as there is a change, it updates your OPA microservice through OPAL Clients. 

OPAL clients keeps your user‚Äôs data up to date by registering webhooks for data updates.
Once a webhook is triggered, data is collected and brought into the policy agents via OPAL data fetchers.

## What is Permit.io?

Permit.io is the permissions infrastructure for the internet.
A fullstack authorization solution enabling developers to bake-in access-control into their products
within minutes and have them ready for future demands from customers and regulation.

Our developer SDK integrates with your app and enables you to add declarative permission
checks that are as easy to use as feature flags.

Our solution is built upon strong open source foundations, enables Git-Ops out of the box,
and goes far beyond enforcement - providing seamless access control **experiences** meant
for humans that simply work out-of-the-box: User Management, API Key management, Audit, User impersonation and so on.
