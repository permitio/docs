## Overview

The Approval Management Element allows users with role "Operation Approval Reviewer" to manage pending requests efficiently.
This element based on [Operation Approval element](/embeddable-uis/element/operation-approval),reviewer and approved roles both will be created on the operation approval element. For view the operation approvals that have been created you will need to assigned the relevant user to the reviewer role.

After the request will approve, the requesting user will be automatically assigned to the approved role (on the relvent resource instance for his request).
 The element displays a list of pending requests, and the reviewer can approve or deny them. The element is designed to be embedded in your application, and it is fully customizable to fit your application's look and feel.



**Example**

Take the example of a bank transfer in the marketing department.
An employee in the marketing department wants to transfer money to an advertising supplier.
An employee cannot make a transfer, he needs approval from a manager, the manager of the marketing department approves the transfer.
A bank transfer is initiated by the employee, and the manager approves it via the Approval Management interface.
