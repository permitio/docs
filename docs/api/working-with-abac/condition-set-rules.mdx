title: Condition Set Rules
---

A condition set rule is a logical expression that combines a **User Set**, **Resource Set** and an **Action**.

In this particular example, the action that is going to be performed will be on a **repository**, and we will want users to **clone** it.

:::tip reminder
Let's remind ourselves of the sets and actions we will be dealing with.

**User Set** - _us_based_employees_<br/>
**Action** - _repository:clone_<br/>
**Resource Set** - _private_repos_
:::

We can now go ahead and assign the rule via the API. With this set we define the following rule:

:::info rule
Employees located in the US have the permissions to clone private repositories.

```javascript
{
    "user_set": "us_based_employees",
    "permissions": [
        "repository:clone"
    ],
    "resource_set": "private_repos"
}
```
