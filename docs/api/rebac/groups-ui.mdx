title: Managing Groups via UI
---

The Groups UI provides an intuitive interface for managing relationship-based permissions for your resource instances and users. Through the UI, you can easily create, edit, and manage groups without writing API calls.

## Accessing Groups

Navigate to **User Management** in your Permit dashboard and select the **Groups** tab to view and manage your groups.

![Groups List View](/img/rebac/groups/groups-list.png)

The Groups view displays all your existing groups with the following information:
- **Group Instance Key**: The unique identifier for the group
- **Group Tenant**: The tenant the group belongs to
- **Resource Type**: The type of resource the group is associated with

## Creating a New Group

To create a new group, click the **+ Create Group** button in the top right corner.

![Create Group Form](/img/rebac/groups/create-group.png)

### Required Fields:

1. **Group Instance Key** (Required)
   - Unique identifier for the group instance
   - Example: `marketing`, `support`, `eng-team`

2. **Tenant**
   - Select the tenant that the group belongs to
   - Default: `Default Tenant`

3. **Resource Type Key** (Optional)
   - The key of the resource type that the group belongs to
   - This connects the group to a specific resource type in your policy

:::tip
The Group Instance Key should be descriptive and follow your team's naming conventions for easy identification.

## Editing Groups

![Edit Group Overview](/img/rebac/groups/three-dot-menu.png)

Click on the three-dot menu (⋮) next to any group to edit it. The Edit Group interface provides several configuration options:

![Edit Group Overview](/img/rebac/groups/edit-group-overview.png)

### Group Information

The basic group information (Group Instance Key and Tenant) is displayed at the top and cannot be modified after creation.

### Managing Users

![Edit Group Users](/img/rebac/groups/edit-group-users.png)

Add users to the group by typing their email addresses in the **Users** field. You can:
- Add multiple users at once
- Remove users by clicking the × next to their email
- Users added to the group will inherit permissions based on the group's role assignments

:::info How it Works:
When you add users to a group, they automatically receive the permissions assigned to that group. For example, if you create a `marketing` group and assign it a `member` role, all users added to this group will automatically become members with the associated permissions.
:::

### Instance Access

[//]: # (![Edit Group Instance Access]&#40;/img/rebac/groups/edit-group-instance-access.png&#41;)

The Instance Access section allows you to grant the group permissions on specific resource instances:

- **Resource Type**: Select the type of resource (e.g., `document`, `social_media`, `campaign`)
- **Resource Instance**: Specify the instance key (e.g., `marketing_plan`, `training_video`, `sales_proposal`)
- **Role**: Assign the role for this instance (e.g., `editor`, `viewer`, `admin`)

:::info Automatic Role Derivation:
Following the previous example, we can create another group in our marketing group titled `social_media`. This group will contain resource instances of marketing materials. We can assign this newly created group the role of editor. The Groups feature creates an automatic derivation between the `social_media#editor` role and the `marketing#member` role - meaning all users with the `marketing#member` role will automatically be assigned with the `social_media#editor` role. New resources added to `social_media` will be accessible to edit by members of the marketing group, and new users added as members to the marketing group will automatically have editor access to social media assets.
:::

Click **Add Instance Access** to grant permissions on additional resource instances.

The description reads: "Grant a user permissions per resource instance, as defined by the associated policy, limited to a single tenant."

### Children Groups

[//]: # (![Edit Group Children]&#40;/img/rebac/groups/edit-group-children.png&#41;)

The Children Groups section allows you to create hierarchical group structures by adding child groups to the current group:

- Add existing groups as children by typing their keys
- Child groups inherit relationship configurations from parent groups
- This enables complex organizational structures (e.g., a `company` group containing `marketing`, `engineering`, and `sales` subgroups)

The description reads: "Add children groups to the group (same tenant only)"

:::tip
Use Children Groups to model your organizational hierarchy. For example, if you have a `company` group, you can add department groups like `marketing`, `engineering`, and `support` as children.

## Example Workflow: Marketing Team Access

Let's walk through a practical example of setting up group-based access for a marketing team:

### Step 1: Create the Marketing Group

1. Click **+ Create Group**
2. Set Group Instance Key: `marketing`
3. Select Tenant: `default`
4. Optionally set Resource Type Key: `teams`
5. Click **Create Group**

### Step 2: Add Team Members

1. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) next to the `marketing` group
2. In the **Users** section, add team member emails:
   - `alice@company.com`
   - `bob@company.com`
   - `carol@company.com`

### Step 3: Assign Instance Access

1. In the **Instance Access** section, click **Add Instance Access**
2. Configure access:
   - Resource Type: `social_media`
   - Resource Instance: `training_video`
   - Role: `editor`

Now all members of the marketing group can edit the training video!

### Step 4: Add Child Groups (Optional)

If you have specialized sub-teams:

1. In the **Children Groups** section, add:
   - `content-team`
   - `design-team`
   - `analytics-team`

These child groups will maintain the relationship hierarchy while allowing for more granular permission management.

## Key Benefits of Using Groups UI

- **Visual Management**: Easily see all your groups and their configurations at a glance
- **Bulk User Assignment**: Add multiple users to groups quickly without individual role assignments
- **Hierarchical Structures**: Create parent-child group relationships for complex organizational models
- **Automatic Permission Derivation**: Leverage automatic role derivation to maintain consistent access control
- **Instance-Level Control**: Grant permissions on specific resource instances to entire groups

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, consistent naming for group keys (e.g., `team-marketing`, `dept-engineering`)
2. **Group Hierarchy**: Design your group structure to reflect your organization's structure
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review group memberships and permissions
4. **Documentation**: Document the purpose and permissions of each group for team reference
5. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic groups and add complexity as needed
