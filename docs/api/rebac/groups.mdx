The Groups API simplifies relationship-based permission management for your resource instances and users by using groups. Groups, as suggested by the name, group together resource instances and users, enabling you to assign group members with permissions on resource instances.

## Key Features:

- **Create, Update, Delete, and List Groups**: The Groups API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints to manage the lifecycle of your groups, ensuring you have complete control over their configuration and membership.


- **Assigning roles to Groups**: Groups can be assigned roles directly (instead of users). When adding users to a group through the API, you set them to automatically derive their permissions from the roles assigned to the group, 
ensuring consistent and manageable access control. See the [Groups API Redoc](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Groups-(Upcoming-Feature)) for more information.


- **Group Resource Instances, and Users**: Organize your resource instances and users into groups, allowing for simplified ReBAC permissions for:

    - **Users:** Including users in a group allows you to assign an entire cluster of users with a single role (Instead of assigning roles to each user individually). 
    You can set a role assigned to the group to be automatically assigned to all its members and revoked once their membership is removed.
    
    :::info Example:
    If we create a marketing group and assign a `member` role to it, we then assign users to the Group via the `member` role. We can then derive other roles based on this assignment (See example below)
    :::
    
    - **Resource Instances**: Grouping resources enables you to manage access control for multiple resources simultaneously, ensuring all included resources share the same permission configuration.

    :::info Example:
    In our marketing group, we can create another group titled `social_media`. This group will contain resource instances of marketing materials. We can assign this newly created group the role of editor. 
    The Groups API allows you to create a derivation between the `social_media#editor` role and the `marketing#member` role - meaning all users with the `marketing#member` role will automatically be assigned 
    with the `social_media#editor` role.
    :::
    :::info Example:
    New resources added to `social_media` will be accessible to edit by members of the marketing group, and new users added as members to the marketing group will automatically 
    have editor access to social media assets.
    :::
        
## Example Usage for User Groups:

Let's get into the previous example with more detail:
Say we want to assign a group of users, the "Marketing Team," "Editor" access to a group of social media resources. We also want them to have "Viewer" access to an external "Training Video" resource.

### Group creation and role assignment:
- Using the Groups API, we'll first create a group named `marketing`.
- Next, we assign the group three roles: `editor`, `viewer`, and `member`.
- Then, we create another group called `social_media` . This group has one role: `content`.

### Setting Up Relationships:
- We assign our users with the `marketing#member` role.
- We assign the `social_media` group with the `content` role.
- We assign `social media` resource instances (`meme_1`, `video_2`, `calendar_3`) the `social-media#content` role.
- Last, we set our external resource - `training_video` to support the `marketing#viewer` role.

#### API Calls: Create Group, Add Role to Group, Add Users to Group:
To **create a new group**, make a POST request to the following with the required data:

```
curl '<https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{project_id}/{env_id}/groups>' \\
 -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'
 --data-raw '{"group_instance_key": "marketing-team"}' \\
```

To **add a new role to group**, make a POST request to the following with the required data:
```
curl '<https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{project_id}/{env_id}/group/{group_resource_type_key}/roles>' \\
 -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' 
 --data-raw '{"resource": "marketing", "resource_instance": "social_media", "role": "viewer", tenant:"business"}' \\
```

#### Assigning Users to a Group
To **add users to a group**, make a PUT request to the following with the required data:
```
curl -X PUT \\
'<https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{project_id}/{env_id}/groups/{group_resource_type_key}/users/{user_id}>' \\
   -H 'authorization
     --data-raw '{"tenant":"business"}' \\
```

### Automated Role Derivation:

![Groups API](/ui-videos/api/rebac/groups-api/docsapi.png)

Once `user-1` is assigned to the marketing group, the following will be automated by the API:

- Assign `user-1` to the `marketing#member` role.
- Create a role derivation from `marketing#member` to `social_media#editor`.
- Create a role derivation from `marketing#member` to `training_video#viewer`.
- Create a role derivation from `social_media#editor` to `social-media#content`.
- Establish a relation between `marketing` and `social-media`.
- Create a relationship between `marketing` and each resource within the `social-media` group.
- Grant `user-1` the role `social_media#editor` in all resources within the `social_media` group.
- Grant `user-1` the role `marketing#viewer`, granting `view` access to the `training_video` instance. 

After these steps, we will have the marketing group, and every user who is a member in this group will have the role editor in all resources within the social-media group, and the role viewer on training_video. Using the Groups API, you can efficiently manage permissions and ensure that all members of the marketing team have the appropriate access to the social media resources group.
