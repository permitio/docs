description: Manage Environments in Permit
---

A Permit environment is a silo (a logical grouping) of your policy (roles, conditions, etc.) and data (users, tenants,
role assignments, etc.). You can create multiple environments for each of your projects. For example, you can create a `production`
environment for your production deployment and a `staging` environment for your staging deployment. Environments can be used for
CI/D flows, testing, and more.

## Create new environment

:::warning Remember
Make sure you use an organization level api-key or project level api-key to create a new environment.
:::

First of all we need to get our `API_SECRET_KEY` from the dashboard and get current `project_id`<br/>

- [Follow this link to get your organization or project API_SECRET_KEY](/api/api-with-cli/#get-your-api-key).<br/>
- [To get your project_id](/api/examples/get-project-and-env).

Replace `API_SECRET_KEY` with your `API_SECRET_KEY` and `project_id` with your `project_id` in the following command.

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/{project_id}/envs' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'\
  --data-raw '{"key":"new-env-name","name":"New Env Name"}'

```

The return environment object will look like this:

```json
{
  "key": "new-env-key",
  "id": "f77b6ee3149e4b90ba3263ecd092xxxx",
  "organization_id": "903ebc2765b848289d6dfbd3c21exxxx",
  "project_id": "3c4244c7bcab4c97990e5bc724dafe85",
  "created_at": "2023-07-30T15:56:21+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2023-07-30T15:56:21+00:00",
  "name": "New Env Name",
  "description": null,
  "custom_branch_name": null,
  "jwks": null,
  "settings": null
}
```


### Environment's Default Permissions
When creating a new environment from the dashboard, if the organization settings "enable_default_roles" is set to true,
the environment settings will be configured to the default values.
These default settings manage the default role and actions for every new resource.
The settings will appear as follows:
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "default_resource_actions": ["create", "read", "update", "delete"],
    "default_resource_permissions": {
      "admin": [
        "create",
        "read",
        "update",
        "delete"
      ],
     "editor": [
        "create",
        "read",
        "update",
      ],
      "viewer": [
        "read",
      ],
    }
    "enable_default_roles": true,
  }
}
```
the settings will be set to null if you create the environment using the API.
you can update the environment settings using the [update environment settings](/api/examples/update-env-settings) endpoint.
The actions for the roles in the default permissions must be a subset of the default resource actions.


## Copy Environment ( EAP )

The copy environment endpoint allows you to copy an existing environment to a new environment or an existing environment.<br/>
It allows you to copy the entire environment or a subset of the **policy** in a specific environment.<br/>
You can also exclude or include specific objects from the copy, it also supports `*` so you can exclude all the roles that starts with test\*<br/>

You can either duplicates an existing environment to a new environment in the same project, or copies from an existing environment to another existing environment.

Copying environments across projects or organizations is not allowed.

:::warning Remember
Make sure you use an organization level api-key or project level api-key to copy an environment.
:::

:::note Supported objects
Copy Environment currently copies the following objects:
- [x] Resource
    - [x] Resource Actions
        - [ ] Resource Action Groups
    - [x] Resource Attributes
    - [x] Resource Roles
    - [x] Resource Relations
- [x] Roles
    - [x] Role Permissions
    - [x] Role Derivations
    - [ ] Role Hierarchy
- [x] Condition Sets
    - [x] User Sets
    - [x] Resource Sets
    - [x] Condition Sets Rules
    - [ ] Condition Sets Inheritance
:::

## Copy to a new environment

In this example I'm coping an environment called `production` environment to a new environment called `staging`.<br/>
And I'm excluding all the roles, resources, user_sets and resource_sets that starts with `test*`.<br/>


### Example

First of all we need to get our `API_SECRET_KEY` from the dashboard and get current `project_id` and `env_id`<br/>

- [Follow this link to get your organization or project API_SECRET_KEY](/api/api-with-cli/#get-your-api-key).<br/>
- [To get your project_id](/api/examples/get-project-and-env).

Replace `API_SECRET_KEY` with your `API_SECRET_KEY` and `project_id` with your `project_id` and `env_id` with your `env_id` in the following command.<br/>

```bash
#curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/default/envs/staging/copy' \
curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/{project_id}/envs/{env_id}/copy' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'\
  --data '{
  "target_env": {
    "new": {
        "key": "prod",
        "name": "production"
    }
  },
  "scope": {
      "roles": {
          "exclude": ["test*"]
      },
      "resources": {
          "exclude": ["test*"]
      },
      "resource_sets": {
          "exclude": ["test*"]
      },
      "user_sets": {
          "exclude": ["test*"]
      }
  }
}'

```

You should get 201 response with the new environment object

## Copy to an existing environment

In this example I'm coping an environment called `production` environment to an existing environment called `staging`.<br/>
And I'm overwriting any existing objects in the target environment. (conflict_strategy: overwrite)<br/>
I can also use the `fail` strategy to fail the copy if there is any conflict in the target environment.

:::note Overwrite strategy
When using the overwrite strategy, the copy will overwrite any editable field in the existing objects in the target environment.
We do not delete any high-level objects that exist in the target environment but do not exist in the source environment,
such as roles, resources, and condition sets.
:::
:::warning Remember
This feature is in **EAP** stage, which means it's in early access and might have some limitations.
We recommend you to test it in a non-production environment before using it in production.
:::

### Example

First of all we need to get our `API_SECRET_KEY` from the dashboard and get current `project_id` and `env_id`<br/>

- [Follow this link to get your organization or project API_SECRET_KEY](/api/api-with-cli/#get-your-api-key).<br/>
- [To get your project_id](/api/examples/get-project-and-env).

Replace `API_SECRET_KEY` with your `API_SECRET_KEY` and `project_id` with your `project_id` and `env_id` with your `env_id` in the following command.<br/>

```bash
#curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/{project_id}/envs/{env_id}/copy' \
curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/default/envs/production/copy' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'\
  --data '{
  "target_env": {
    "existing": "staging"
  },
  "conflict_strategy": "overwrite",
}'

```

You should get 201 response with the new environment object

## Copy Environment in a GitOps Project

When using GitOps and copying an environment to a new target environment,
the target environment will also include the custom policies
under `custom` directory.

If you are using GitOps and copying an environment to an existing target environment,
the custom policies under `custom`
directory will be copied only if the conflict strategy is `overwrite`.<br />
If you have GitOps configured on your Project and you didn't set the strategy as overwrite it will ignore
any custom policies in the source environment.
You can modify the custom policies to copy with `custom_policies` key in the request "scope" object.
For example:

```json
{
   "target_env":{
      "existing":"production"
   },
   "conflict_strategy":"overwrite",
   "scope":{
      "custom_policies":{
         "include":[
            "tmp_policy.rego",
            "my_policy*"
         ],
         "exclude":[
            "ignored*"
         ]
      }
   }
}
```


## Customize GitOps Branch Name

When setting up a Custom Branch name in your GitOps repository for an environment. <br />
Permit will use the branch name to sync the environment policy with the repository.<br />
Notice that the Policy Repo should be activated on the project for it to work properly,
you can activate the Policy Repo by following the following [guide](/integrations/gitops/github#configure-permit-to-use-your-repository).

### Example

Create a new environment with a custom branch name.

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/{project_id}/envs' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer {API_SECRET_KEY}'\
  --data-raw '{"key":"new-env-name","name":"New Env Name", "custom_branch_name": "new-env-branch-name"}'
```

The response should look like this:

```json
{
  "key": "new-env-name",
  "id": "f77b6ee3149e4b90ba3263ecd092xxxx",
  "organization_id": "903ebc2765b848289d6dfbd3c21exxxx",
  "project_id": "3c4244c7bcab4c97990e5bc724dafe85",
  "created_at": "2023-07-30T15:56:21+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2023-07-30T15:56:21+00:00",
  "name": "New Env Name",
  "description": null,
  "custom_branch_name": "new-env-branch-name",
  "jwks": null,
  "settings": null
}
```




Or update an existing environment with a custom branch name.

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/{project_id}/envs/{env_id}' -X 'PATCH' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer {API_SECRET_KEY}'\
  --data-raw '{"custom_branch_name": "new-env-branch-name"}'
```

The response should look like this:

```json
{
  "key": "new-env-name",
  "id": "f77b6ee3149e4b90ba3263ecd092xxxx",
  "organization_id": "903ebc2765b848289d6dfbd3c21exxxx",
  "project_id": "3c4244c7bcab4c97990e5bc724dafe85",
  "created_at": "2023-07-30T15:56:21+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2023-07-30T15:56:21+00:00",
  "name": "New Env Name",
  "description": null,
  "custom_branch_name": "new-env-branch-name",
  "jwks": null,
  "settings": null
}
```
