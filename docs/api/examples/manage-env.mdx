# Overview

A Permit environment is a silo (logical grouping) of your policy (e.g. roles, conditions, etc.) and data (users, tenants, role assignments, etc.) . You can create multiple environments for each of your projects. For example, you can create a `production` environment for your production deployment and a `staging` environment for your staging deployment. Environments can be used for CI/D flows, testing, and more.
Each environment has its own access-control (yes, it's access control for your access-control :D )
You can create environments dynamically using the API.

For example you can create a `production` environment for your production users and a `staging` environment for your staging users. You can also create a `test` environment for your test users. You can create as many environments as you want for your project.


# Create Environment

:::warning Remember
Make sure you use an organization level api-key or project level api-key to create a new environment. 
:::


First of all we need to get our `API_SECRET_KEY` from the dashboard and get current `project_id`<br/>
- [Follow this link to get your organization or project API_SECRET_KEY](/api/api-with-cli/#get-your-api-key).<br/>
- [To get your project_id](/api/examples/get-project-and-env).

Replace `API_SECRET_KEY` with your `API_SECRET_KEY` and `project_id` with your `project_id` in the following command.

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/{project_id}/envs' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'\
  --data-raw '{"key":"new-env-name","name":"New Env Name"}' 

# the return environment object will look like this:
#{
#    "key": "new-env-key",
#    "id": "f77b6ee3149e4b90ba3263ecd092xxxx",
#    "organization_id": "903ebc2765b848289d6dfbd3c21exxxx",
#    "project_id": "3c4244c7bcab4c97990e5bc724dafe85",
#    "created_at": "2023-07-30T15:56:21+00:00",
#    "updated_at": "2023-07-30T15:56:21+00:00",
#    "name": "New Env Name",
#    "description": null,
#    "custom_branch_name": null,
#    "jwks": null,
#    "settings": null
#}
```


# Copy Environment (Clone)

## Overview
The copy environment endpoint allows you to copy an existing environment to a new environment or an existing environment.<br/>
It allows you to copy the entire environment or a subset of the policy in a specific environment.<br/>
You can also exclude or include specific objects from the copy, it also supports `*` so you can exclude all the roles that starts with test*<br/>

You can either duplicates an existing environment to a new environment in the same project, or copies from an existing environment to another existing environment.

Copying environments across projects or organizations is not allowed.

:::warning Remember
Make sure you use an organization level api-key or project level api-key to copy an environment.

## Copy to a new environment

### Outline

In this example I'm coping `production` environment to a new environment called `production`.<br/>
And I'm excluding all the roles, resources, user_sets and resource_sets that starts with `test*`.<br/>

### Example

First of all we need to get our `API_SECRET_KEY` from the dashboard and get current `project_id` and `env_id`<br/>
- [Follow this link to get your organization or project API_SECRET_KEY](/api/api-with-cli/#get-your-api-key).<br/>
- [To get your project_id](/api/examples/get-project-and-env).

Replace `API_SECRET_KEY` with your `API_SECRET_KEY` and `project_id` with your `project_id` and `env_id` with your `env_id` in the following command.<br/>

```bash
#curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/default/envs/staging/copy' \
curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/{project_id}/envs/{env_id}/copy' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'\
  --data '{
  "target_env": {
    "new": {
        "key": "prod",
        "name": "production"
    }
  },
  "scope": {
      "roles": {
          "exclude": ["test*"]
      },
      "resources": {
          "exclude": ["test*"]
      },
      "resource_sets": {
          "exclude": ["test*"]
      },
      "user_sets": {
          "exclude": ["test*"]
      }
  }
}'

# you should get 201 response with the new environment object
```

## Copy to an existing environment

### Outline

In this example I'm coping `production` environment to an existing environment called `staging`.<br/>
And I'm overwriting any existing objects in the target environment. (conflict_strategy: overwrite)<br/>
I can also use the `fail` strategy to fail the copy if there is any conflict in the target environment.

### Example

First of all we need to get our `API_SECRET_KEY` from the dashboard and get current `project_id` and `env_id`<br/>
- [Follow this link to get your organization or project API_SECRET_KEY](/api/api-with-cli/#get-your-api-key).<br/>
- [To get your project_id](/api/examples/get-project-and-env).

Replace `API_SECRET_KEY` with your `API_SECRET_KEY` and `project_id` with your `project_id` and `env_id` with your `env_id` in the following command.<br/>

```bash
#curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/{project_id}/envs/{env_id}/copy' \
curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/default/envs/production/copy' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'\
  --data '{
  "target_env": {
    "existing": "staging"
  },
  "conflict_strategy": "overwrite",
}'

# you should get 201 response with the new environment object
```
