# Background APIs (EAP)

:::info Early Access Program
Background APIs are part of the Early Access Program (EAP) and are subject to change.
:::

Some APIs in Permit run in the background, and can be triggered without awaiting the response.
These APIs are commonly used for operations that require scheduling, are not time-sensitive, or may take significant time to complete.

For example, we will use the Copy Environment API to explain how to use background APIs.

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/default/envs/staging/copy/async' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'\
  --data '{
  "target_env": {
    "new": {
        "key": "prod",
        "name": "production"
    }
  }
}'
# Response: 202 Accepted
```
When triggering a Copy Environment, the API will return a `202 Accepted` response, indicating that the job has been accepted and is being processed in the background.

The response contains info about the task, including the `task_id` that can be used to check the status of the task.

```json
{
  "task_id": "adf8f4e3-5e01-4140-b512-142533007edd",
  "status": "processing",
  "result": null,
  "error": null
}
```

After some time, you can check the status of the task using the `task_id`.

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/default/envs/staging/copy/async/{task_id}/result' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'
```

```json
{
  "task_id": "string",
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "key": "prod",
    "id": "497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08",
    "organization_id": "7c60d51f-b44e-4682-87d6-449835ea4de6",
    "project_id": "405d8375-3514-403b-8c43-83ae74cfe0e9",
    "created_at": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
    "updated_at": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
    "avp_policy_store_id": "",
    "name": "production",
    "description": "",
    "custom_branch_name": "",
    "jwks": {},
    "settings": {}
  }
}
```

## Waiting for Background tasks

You can also wait for the background task to complete by using the `wait` query parameter.

The wait parameter specify the maximum time to wait for the task to complete in seconds.
By default, `wait=0` will return immediately with the current status of the task.
As soon as the task complete, the API will respond the result of the task.

You can provide the `wait` parameter to the initial request or the result status check request.

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/default/envs/staging/copy/async?wait=60` \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'
```

Background tasks may take a long time, up to 30 minutes, so you may want to check the status every couple of seconds.

## Error Handling

When a background task fails, the API will still return a `200 OK` response, but the status will be `failed`, and the error message will be included in the response.

```json
{
  "task_id": "adf8f4e3-5e01-4140-b512-142533007edd",
  "status": "failed",
  "result": null,
  "error": {
    "id": "adf8f4e3-5e01-4140-b512-142533007edd",
    "error_code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "title": "We could not find the requested object/s",
    "message": "The requested data could not be found, we could not find 'Environment' with the given filters. Please try again with different filters.\nIf you are sure there is an object with the given filters, contact our support on Slack for further guidance.",
    "support_link": "https://permit-io.slack.com/ssb/redirec"
  }
}
```
