## PDP/SDK OpenAPI spec - local version

Just like the Permit.io cloud service, the local PDP exposes an OpenAPI spec which can be used to develop your own SDKs.
Assuming you're running your PDP at `localhost:7000` you can access the spec at `http://localhost:7000/openapi.json` and view the docs at `http://localhost:7000/redoc`.
