The Regex URL Mapping Permissions Check is a powerful feature that allows you to control access to your application's endpoints based on regular expressions for complex URL patterns. This feature supports two approaches:


:::warning
FoAz is deprecated and no longer supported, but it is still available at <a href="https://app.permit.io/foaz-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app.permit.io/foaz-proxy</a> . 

For URL-Based permission - weâ€™re introducing [URL Mapping](/foaz/url-mapping-check).
:::


## Overview
Regex URL Mapping in Permit.io enables you to:
- Define complex URL patterns using regular expressions to match dynamic and flexible URL structures
- Extract multiple parameters from both URL paths and query strings using named capture groups
- Match URLs with optional components, varying subdomains, or complex validation rules
- Apply the same permission rules to multiple URL patterns that follow similar structures
- Handle dynamic routing patterns that can't be easily expressed with simple path parameters
- Support both HTTP and HTTPS protocols, and match across different domains or environments
- Create flexible and maintainable access control rules that adapt to your API's URL structure

:::info
This feature is currently only available through the Permit.io API & PDP API.

### Regex Pattern Basics

Regex URL mapping uses named capture groups (e.g., `(?P<param_name>pattern)`) to extract values from the URL. These captured values are automatically passed as attributes to your policy, making them available for ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) rules.

### Setting Up Regex URL Mapping

Here's an example of creating a proxy configuration with a regex URL mapping rule:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{project_id}/{env_id}/proxy_configs' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERMIT_KEY' \
--data '{
  "name": "Users API",
  "key": "users_api",
  "mapping_rules": [
    {
      "url": "^https://api\\.example\\.com/api/v1/users/(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)/profile$",
      "http_method": "post",
      "resource": "users",
      "action": "update",
      "url_type": "regex"
    }
  ],
  "secret":"abc123notUsed"
}'
```

:::danger

Noitce in the API call, the regex pattern is being sent as a JSON string. In JSON, backslashes need to be escaped themselves, so `\.` becomes `\\.` in the JSON payload.

:::

Key points about this configuration:
- The `url_type` must be set to `"regex"` to enable regex pattern matching
- The regex pattern uses named capture groups (`?P<name>pattern`) to extract values
- The pattern matches URLs that contain a numeric user ID in the path
- The extracted user_id value will be available as an attribute in your policy

:::note 
The `secret` value is still required for now, even though it isn't used. This will be fixed in a future relase of the proxy_configs API.

### Checking Permissions

To use the URL Mapping Permissions Check, you must first start your PDP. 

```bash
docker run -it \
  -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=permit_key_{your_permit_env_key} \
  --env PDP_DEBUG=True \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

:::info
Simple URL mapping is supported in PDP version 0.8.0 or higher
:::

Currently, checking permissions using URL Mapping is available through the endpoint `/allowed_url` on the PDP. The SDKs will be updated to support this feature soon.

Here's an example of a payload to `localhost:7766/allowed_url` (assuming you're running the PDP locally):

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:7766/allowed_url' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer permit_key_{your_key}' \
--data '{
  "user": {
    "key": "raz@permit.io"
  },
  "url": "https://api.example.com/users/123/profile",
  "http_method": "post",
  "tenant": "default"
}'
```

### Common Regex Patterns

<TimelineWrapper>
<TimelineStep>


#### Basic Path Parameter
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https://api\\.example\\.com/users/(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)/profile$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern will match URLs with a numeric user ID in the path. It will match:

`https://api.example.com/users/123/profile`

`https://api.example.com/users/456/profile`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https://` | Matches the protocol literally |
| `api\.example\.com` | Matches the domain (dots are escaped with backslashes) |
| `/users/` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)` | Named capture group:<br/>- `?P<user_id>`: Names the captured value "user_id"<br/>- `[0-9]+`: Matches one or more digits |
| `/profile` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is perfect for RESTful APIs where you need to extract a numeric ID from a fixed URL structure.

</TimelineStep>

<TimelineStep>


#### Optional Path Component
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https://api\\.example\\.com/api/users(?:/(?P<user_id>[0-9]+))?$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern will match URLs with an optional user ID. It will match:

`https://api.example.com/api/users`

`https://api.example.com/api/users/123`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https://` | Matches the protocol literally |
| `api\.example\.com` | Matches the domain (dots are escaped with backslashes) |
| `/api/users` | Matches the literal path segments |
| `(?:...)` | Non-capturing group (used for grouping without capturing) |
| `(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)` | Named capture group:<br/>- `?P<user_id>`: Names the captured value "user_id"<br/>- `[0-9]+`: Matches one or more digits |
| `?` | Makes the entire group optional |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is useful when you have endpoints that can work both with and without an ID, like a list endpoint vs. a detail endpoint.

</TimelineStep>

#### Multiple Query Parameters
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https://api\\.example\\.com/search\\?(?=.*q=(?P<query>[^&]+))(?=.*page=(?P<page>[0-9]+)).*$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern will match URLs with specific query parameters in any order. It will match:

`https://api.example.com/search?q=test&page=1`

`https://api.example.com/search?page=2&q=example`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https://` | Matches the protocol literally |
| `api\.example\.com` | Matches the domain (dots are escaped with backslashes) |
| `/search` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `\?` | Matches the literal question mark (escaped) |
| `(?=...)` | Positive lookahead (ensures something exists without consuming it) |
| `.*` | Matches any characters |
| `[^&]+` | Matches one or more characters that aren't ampersands (for query values) |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is ideal for search endpoints where parameters can appear in any order.

</TimelineStep>

<TimelineStep>


#### Subdomain Matching
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https://[\\w-]+\\.example\\.com/api/v1/users/(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern will match URLs with any subdomain. It will match:

`https://api.example.com/api/v1/users/123`

`https://staging.example.com/api/v1/users/456`

`https://dev-api.example.com/api/v1/users/789`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https://` | Matches the protocol literally |
| `[\w-]+` | Matches one or more word characters or hyphens:<br/>- `\w`: matches letters, numbers, and underscores<br/>- `-`: allows hyphens in subdomains |
| `\.example\.com` | Matches the domain (dots are escaped with backslashes) |
| `/api/v1/users/` | Matches the literal path segments |
| `(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)` | Named capture group:<br/>- `?P<user_id>`: Names the captured value "user_id"<br/>- `[0-9]+`: Matches one or more digits |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is perfect for environments like staging, dev, or production APIs.

#### Flexible User Path Matching
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https?:\\/\\/[^\\/]+(?:.*?\\/users(?:\\/(?P<user_id>[^\\/]+))?(?:\\/.*)?)?$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern is useful for matching any URL that contains a user ID, regardless of the exact path structure. It will match URLs like:

`https://api.example.com/users/123`

`https://api.example.com/v1/users/123`

`https://api.example.com/v1/users/123/profile`

`https://api.example.com/v1/users/123/settings/notifications`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https?` | Matches "http" or "https" (the 's' is optional) |
| `:\/\/` | Matches the literal "://" (forward slashes are escaped) |
| `[^\/]+` | Matches the domain (any characters except forward slashes) |
| `.*?` | Non-greedy match of any characters |
| `(?:\/.*)?` | Optional trailing path segments |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is extremely flexible, matching any URL structure that contains a user ID, making it useful for complex API structures.

</TimelineStep>

#### Protocol-Agnostic Matching
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https?:\\/\\/api\\.example\\.com\\/users\\/(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)\\/profile$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern will match both HTTP and HTTPS URLs. It will match:

`http://api.example.com/users/123/profile`

`https://api.example.com/users/123/profile`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https?` | Matches "http" or "https" (the 's' is optional) |
| `:\/\/` | Matches the literal "://" (forward slashes are escaped) |
| `api\.example\.com` | Matches the domain (dots are escaped) |
| `/users/` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)` | Named capture group:<br/>- `?P<user_id>`: Names the captured value "user_id"<br/>- `[0-9]+`: Matches one or more digits |
| `/profile` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is useful when your API needs to support both secure and non-secure connections, or during development when testing with different protocols.

</TimelineStep>

<TimelineStep>


#### Domain-Agnostic Matching
```json
//JSON Escaped Regex URL
"url": "^https:\\/\\/[^\\/]+\\/api\\/v1\\/users\\/(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)\\/profile$"
```
:::tip Matches
This pattern will match any domain name. It will match:

`https://api.example.com/api/v1/users/123/profile`

`https://api.staging.example.com/api/v1/users/123/profile`

`https://api.production.example.com/api/v1/users/123/profile`
:::

| Pattern Part | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `^` | Matches the start of the string |
| `https:\/\/` | Matches the literal "https://" (forward slashes are escaped) |
| `[^\/]+` | Matches the domain (any characters except forward slashes) |
| `/api/v1/` | Matches the literal API version path |
| `/users/` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `(?P<user_id>[0-9]+)` | Named capture group:<br/>- `?P<user_id>`: Names the captured value "user_id"<br/>- `[0-9]+`: Matches one or more digits |
| `/profile` | Matches the literal path segment |
| `$` | Matches the end of the string |

This pattern is ideal for microservices architectures where the same API might be deployed across different domains or environments, allowing you to reuse the same permission rules regardless of the domain.

### Best Practices

1. **Escape Special Characters**: Always escape special characters in your regex patterns (e.g., `\.` for dots in domains).
2. **Use Anchors**: Start patterns with `^` and end with `$` to ensure complete URL matching.
3. **Named Groups**: Always use named capture groups for parameters you want to extract.
4. **Test Patterns**: Test your regex patterns thoroughly before deploying to production.
5. **Keep Patterns Simple**: While regex is powerful, try to keep patterns as simple as possible for better maintainability.
