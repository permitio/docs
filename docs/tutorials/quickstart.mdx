# Quickstart: Add permissions to your app

In this tutorial, we will show you how to integrate your app with Permit.io in a few minutes.

## Setup Your PDP container

We provide a Policy-Decision-Point - aka an authorization microservice, as a container for you to use.
Follow these steps to install:

#### 1. Pull our PDP container from Docker Hub ([Click here to install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/])):

```
docker pull permitio/pdp:latest
```
#### 2. Get Permit.io API key

Navigate to [Project management](https://app.permit.io/project-management).  
Find the active environment with the green dot on the icon.  
Click on "Copy secret key" button of the active environment.  
Or:  
Click on your user icon at the top right of the screen and click there "Copy SDK secret key".

#### 3. Run the container (replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your API key):

```
docker run \
  -p 7000:7000 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  permitio/pdp

```

## Add the SDK to your code - per lanague:

1. [Node.js](/reference/SDKs/nodejs)
2. [Python](/reference/SDKs/python)

more SDKs coming soon...
