# How to update OPAL in real-time with 3rd party services

This step-by-step article will teach you how to update OPAL in real time to support any data source.

### Why do you need to update OPAL in real-time?
The data relevant for authorization can arrive from various data sources, often from 3rd party applications, i.e., billing information from Stripe or PayPal, CRM information from SalesForce or Monday
In order to have the data from any data source, using [OPAL DataFetchers](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/docs/HOWTO/write_your_own_fetch_provider.md) and OPA.

### What are Data Fetchers?
Data fetchers are pluggable components OPAL use for policy enforcement efforts. They are used to fetch data from a specific source and know if a user is permitted to perform the specific action or not.

We designed OPAL to be extensible, and therefore you can and even be encouraged to build your fetcher.

### A bird's-view
Before we start with the step by step manual, letâ€™s understand how your custom data fetcher will be called:
- OPAL will search for fetch providers based on the env var called OPAL_FETCH_PROVIDER_MODULES, defined here.
  - Example of an env var: OPAL_FETCH_PROVIDER_MODULES=opal_common.fetcher.providers,opal_fetcher_postgres.provider
- OPAL will parse this var as a comma-separated list, and for each item in the list, OPAL will find the python module and import it.
- OPAL will look for the subclasses of BaseFetchProvider.

### Step by Step - Writing Data Fetchers for OPAL
To write a new data fetcher for OPAL, we will follow the following steps:
- Extend BaseFetcherProvider
- Implement the fetching logic under the _fetch_() method
  - _Optional step_: implement _process_()
- Publish your new fetcher as a pip package. You can tell OPAL to use it with the config env var OPAL_FETCH_PROVIDER_MODULES.

**Pro tip**: Clone our code sample and start editing as needed.
