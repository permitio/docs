title: Connecting to Authentication
---

Permit.io, being an **[authorization solution](/overview/glossary)**, naturally requires integration with your authentication
solution. This section outlines the process of connecting Permit.io with your authentication setup.

# Connect via JWTs or UUIDs

To seamlessly integrate with Permit.io, simply pass the returned JWT (JsonWebToken) or its unique ID from any modern authentication
solution (such as Auth0, AWS Cognito, Firebase, FusionAuth, Stych, Magic, or even your own custom solution) to the permit.check()
function.

For straightforward applications, utilizing the user's email address as the unique ID is feasible, although we advise against
this practice.

# Authn -> AuthZ handoff points

There are three stages for your users' authentication:

- Sign-up: Initial setup of user prior to the first time they log-in
- Sign-in: follow-up session where the user's identity is verified
- Permission-checks - enforcement of permissions for the verified user's actions

### Sign up

When a user signs up for your application, you retrieve basic information about the user (either from them or their identify management) via your authentication solution.
At which point you can introduce the user to Permit.io as well via the [syncUser](/sdk/python/usage-example/#create-or-update-a-user-sync-user) [[Python](/sdk/python/usage-example/#create-or-update-a-user-sync-user) | [Nodejs](/reference/SDKs/nodejs/sync_user) | [Java](/reference/SDKs/Java/sync_user) | [C#](/reference/SDKs/Dotnet/sync_user)] API/SDK call.
At this point you should have a unique identifier for the user (provided by your authentication solution).
You can use this opportunity to setup an initial role for the user in your application per their tenant; at this point you can translate the claims the AuthN solution provides in the JWT to a Permit.io role.

### Sign-in

In subsequent connections to the application, users login and their identity is verified by your Authentication solution.
You can pass the identity from the JWT directly to Permit.io checks

### Permission-checks

Per action/resource the user is trying to access you can pass the JWT |(or the UUID derived from it) to Permit.io to check if the user has permission to do so.
As mentioned above this is the first argument expected by [`permit.check()`](/overview/connecting-your-app#select-your-language)

## Example applications using Permit.io and an AuthN solution

- [Home-brewed authentication for a Python Flask app using Hasura and PostgreSQL](https://github.com/permitio/permit-hasura-python-example)

  ```python
    @app.route("/login", methods=["POST"])
    def login_handler():
    args = AuthArgs.from_request(request.get_json())
    user_response = client.find_user_by_email(args.email)
    user = user_response["data"]["user"][0]
    try:
    Password.verify(user.get("password"), args.password)
    rehash_and_save_password_if_needed(user, args.password)
    return JsonWebToken(generate_token(user)).to_json()
    except VerifyMismatchError:
    return {"message": "Invalid credentials"}, 401

    @app.route("/animals", methods=["GET"])
    def list_animals():
    try:
    token = get_token_from_header() # We used the email as our unique identifier (in Prod a UUID would be better)
    id = token["email"] # enforce app-level access with Permit
    if permit.check(id, "list", "animals"):
    user_response = client.list_animals()
    return jsonify(user_response["data"]["user"])
    else:
    return make_response(jsonify({
    'message': 'Not allowed'
    } )), 403
  ```

- [Authentication for a Nodejs Express app using Auth0](https://github.com/permitio/todoapp-node)
  ```js
  router.post(
  	"",
  	async function (
  		req: express.Request,
  		res: express.Response,
  		next: express.NextFunction
  	) {
  		// permissions check
  		const permitted = await permit.check(req.activeUser?.id, "create", {
  			type: "task",
  			tenant: req.params.boardId,
  		});
  		if (!permitted) {
  			res.status(403).send("Forbidden: not allowed by policy!");
  			return;
  		}
  		// ...
  	}
  );
  ```
