# Overview

The PDP container is built to support your product's scale and needs.

Let's take a look at it:

![Permit data model](/img/screenshots/hierarchy-overview.png)

## Workspace

The first hierarchy level is your workspace, which you defined in the onboarding.

## Project

Within your organization, you can have multiple projects.
Each project represents your offerings, where an offering can be a different product, software, or tool.
By default, we defined “default organization” for you.

Manage projects from the [project management screen](https://app.permit.io/project-management).

:::note
If you have one product line, you can ignore this hierarchy level.

## Environment

Within your project, you create environments, i.e., dev, staging, production, etc.
Every environment has a secret key that you use to check permissions through Permit’s SDK and APIs.

Manage environments from the [project management screen](https://app.permit.io/project-management).

## Policy

A policy consists of users, actions, and resources.
A policy resides in an environment.

Manage policies from the [policy editor page](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor).

### Tenants

A tenant is a group of users that share a common organizational identity.
Usually, each tenant will represent one of the end-customer companies (i.e., the company you sell to).
Read more about tenants [here](/overview/glossary#tenant).

Manage tenants from the [user management screen](https://app.permit.io/user-management).

### Roles

Roles exist on an organization level - whether you change project, tenant, or environment, the same roles exist for you.

Manage roles as part of the [policy editor page](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor).

Resources are tied to the selected environment.

Users are nested under tenants. <br/>
Each user can be associated with multiple tenants.
