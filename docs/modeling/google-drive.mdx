# Modeling Google Drive Permissions with ReBAC

This tutorial explains how to build a simplified [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)-like permission system using [Permit.io](https://permit.io).

:::info Early Access Feature
**[ReBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship-based_access_control)** (relationship based access control) is now in early access. &nbsp; this is a production ready feature, but API's are still subject to change, and performance upgrades will be added. **[Contact us](https://bit.ly/permit-slack)** for more information.
:::

## Before you begin

1. [Sign up to Permit.io](getting-started/create-your-account#onboarding)
2. [Get your environment API Key](/getting-started/quickstart#get-your-permitio-environment-api-key)
3. (optionally) Install and init the Permit SDK (if you are not calling the API directly)

### Early access SDKs

You will need to install an early-access version of the SDKs to use ReBAC functions.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

To install the early access python SDK:

```sh
pip install permit==2.1.0rc1
```

All other instructions from the [Python quickstart](/sdk/python/quickstart-python) remain the same.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

To install the early access Node.js SDK:

```sh
npm install permitio@2.1.0-rc.0
```

All other instructions from the [Node.js quickstart](/sdk/nodejs/quickstart-nodejs) remain the same.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

To install the early access Java SDK you'll need version `1.4.0-rc`.

For [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) projects, use:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.permit</groupId>
  <artifactId>permit-sdk-java</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.0-rc</version>
</dependency>
```

For [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) projects, configure `permit-sdk-java` as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...

    implementation 'io.permit:permit-sdk-java:1.4.0-rc'
}
```

All other instructions from the [Java quickstart](/sdk/java/quickstart-java) remain the same.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Setup your environment

If you are calling the API directly using cURL or Postman, you'll need to setup a few environment variables.
Alternatively if you are working with one of the Permit SDKs, you'll need to initialize the SDK with your API key.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

For cURL/Postman, setup the following environment variables:

```bash
export permit_project="<your-project-key>" # for example: the `default` project
export permit_env="<your-environment-key>" # for example: the `dev` environment
export permit_sdk_api_key="<your-api-key>" # for example: `permit_key_...`
```

The API key you should use for your API calls must be an [environment-level API key](/getting-started/quickstart#get-your-permitio-environment-api-key).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## What you will be building

Google drive is a system you can use to store, share, and collaborate on files and folders.

The G-Drive permission model is [documented here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/ref-roles).
For simplicity we will implement a subset of it with Permit.

### Requirements

1. **Object Hierarchy:** A google drive account can contain many folders and files. Folders can contain other files and folders.
2. **Direct file access:** A user can be a viewer of file, a commenter (meaning they can view and comment on the contents) or an editor (can view, comment and edit).
3. **Folder-level access:** A user can be granted access to a folder. A user access level on a certain folder will grant that same access level on all the files within the folder.
4. **Account admin access:** A user can be granted admin access to the entire account, which will grant the highest permission level on all folders and files within the account.
5. **General access to "Everyone in account":** Files can be shared with all the users who are associated with the account that contains the file (share with all account members).

### Test objects

To verify our system work, we will define a few objects (resource instances) and a few users.

The instances we will define:

```
- a `2023_report` file
- a `finance` folder
- an `acme` account
```

The hierarchy we will define is:

```
- the `2023_report` file is located within the `finance` folder
- both `file:2023_report` and `folder:finance` belong to the `acme` account.
```

The users we will define are

```js
- John who has `viewer` access to file:2023_report // direct file access
- Jane who has `editor` access to folder:finance // folder level access
```

## Modeling the Resource Graph

### Define resources and roles

#### Resources

**Resources** in Permit are types of objects that you can enforce permissions on. Each resource has a predefined set of actions that a user can perform on it.

Permit ReBAC allows you to model your resources as a graph.
Each resource (a type) is a node in the graph, and can connect to other resources via edges called **relations**.

The resources we will define for this example are:

```
- Account
- Folder
- File
```

#### Resource Roles

Each resource type can define its own roles. A **resource role** represents an access level (or a set of permissions) that can be granted on instances of a specific resource type.

Resource roles are typically denoted as `Folder#editor`, which means "a resource role with key `editor` that is defined on the resource type with key `Folder`".

The resource roles we will define are:

```
- Account#admin
- Account#member

- Folder#editor
- Folder#commenter
- Folder#viewer

- File#editor
- File#commenter
- File#viewer
```

#### The Account Resource

The `Account` resource type represents an organization's account in Google Drive. Later in the tutorial, we'll create a specific instance of this resource type for our fictional company, ACME, Inc.

            }
        }
    }
)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We've created the `Account` resource, with three actions: `invite-member`, `list-members`, and `remove-member`.

We've also created two roles, `admin` and `member`. The `admin` role has permission to perform all actions, while the `member` action can only perform `list-members`.

Let's do the same with the `Folder` and `File` resource types.

### Define relations

A **relation** is a type of an edge in the graph between two resources.

A relation called `parent` between a `File` resource and a `Folder` allows you to create **relationship tuples** of this type between a `File` instance and a `Folder` instance.

In other words, a relation is a **type** of a relationship (i.e: relationship tuple).

Example relation:

```
File -> parent -> Folder
```

Example of a relationship tuple of this type:

```
(Folder:soc2, parent, File:access-control-policy)
```

The relations we will define are:

```js
Folder.account -> Account // relation from folder to its parent account
File.account -> Account // relation from file to its parent account
Folder.parent -> Folder // relation from folder to its parent folder
File.parent -> Folder // relation from file to its parent folder
```

:::info The direction of relations/relationships
Note that the direction of a relation is typically **from the object resource to the subject resource**.
However for relationships, we read the relationship tuple **from the subject to the object**, in the reverse direction.
:::

#### File -> parent -> Folder

We'll define the parent relation, linking a file to the folder that contains it. As discussed before, relations define the kind of links that can exist between resource instances, so we define them on their corresponding resource types.

Note that the relation is defined on the `file` resource `/relations` endpoint. A relation will always be defined on the **object** resource. Within the request body, you must specify the **subject** resource (the resource where the relation points to).

#### Folder -> parent -> Folder

Obviously, folders can also be in folders, so let's create that as well. Note that this relation is recursive, which means that it points from a resource type to itself, but the relationships that are defined using them will not necessarily be from an resource instance to itself - usually they'll point to another instance of the same type.

## Implementing Google Drive's Permissions

### 1. Direct file access

Before we can show how to assign direct file access to users, we need to model these files and users.

#### Creating the user

We create a user john@acme.com who will have a direct `viewer` access to a file:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/$permit_project/$permit_env/users \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $permit_sdk_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key": "john@acme.com"
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.api.sync_user(
    {
        "key": "john@acme.com",
    }
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.api.syncUser({
  key: "john@acme.com",
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Creating the file

Now let's create the file instance:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/$permit_project/$permit_env/resource_instances \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $permit_sdk_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resource": "file",
    "key": "2023_report",
    "tenant": "default"
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.api.resource_instances.create(
    {
        "resource": "file",
        "key": "2023_report",
        "tenant": "default"
    }
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.api.resourceInstances.create({
  resource: "file",
  key: "2023_report",
  tenant: "default",
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Tenant-boundaries for resource instances
Note that a resource instance must always belong to a tenant so that tenant-boundaries can still be maintained for end-customers.
The tenant can be used to signify a completely separated end-customer account on your system.
:::

#### Assigning the viewer role to the user

In order to assign the viewer access on the file, we must create a **role assignment** object.

Let's give John read-only access (i.e. the `viewer` role) to the `2023_report` file:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/$permit_project/$permit_env/role_assignments \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $permit_sdk_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user": "john@acme.com",
    "role": "viewer",
    "resource_instance": "file:2023_report"
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.api.role_assignments.assign(
    {
        "user": "john@acme.com",
        "role": "viewer",
        "resource_instance": "file:2023_report",
    }
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.api.roleAssignments.assign({
  user: "john@acme.com",
  role: "viewer",
  resource_instance: "file:2023_report",
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Bonus: creating resource instances implicitly

We could actually achieve the same result with fewer api calls.

Creating the user will remain the same as before, but we can skip creating the file and instead assign the role based on the instance key.
Permit will assume such instance exists on your end and create it implicitly.

Let's give John read-only access (i.e. the `viewer` role) to the `2023_report` file (and create the file implicitly):

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/$permit_project/$permit_env/role_assignments \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $permit_sdk_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user": "john@acme.com",
    "role": "viewer",
    "resource_instance": "file:2023_report",
    "tenant": "default",
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.api.role_assignments.assign(
    {
        "user": "john@acme.com",
        "role": "viewer",
        "resource_instance": "file:2023_report",
        "tenant": "default",
    }
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.api.roleAssignments.assign({
  user: "john@acme.com",
  role: "viewer",
  resource_instance: "file:2023_report",
  tenant: "default",
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that tenant **must be specified** if the resource instance is to be created implicitly.

### 2. Folder-level access

Just like we can give permissions on files, we can do the same on folders. Let's grant Jane the `editor` role on the `finance` folder.

We'll create a user for jane first:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/$permit_project/$permit_env/users \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $permit_sdk_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key": "jane@acme.com"
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.api.sync_user(
    {
        "key": "jane@acme.com",
    }
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.api.syncUser({
  key: "jane@acme.com",
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then we create the folder instance:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/$permit_project/$permit_env/resource_instances \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $permit_sdk_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resource": "folder",
    "key": "finance",
    "tenant": "default"
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.api.resource_instances.create(
    {
        "resource": "folder",
        "key": "finance",
        "tenant": "default"
    }
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.api.resourceInstances.create({
  resource: "folder",
  key: "finance",
  tenant: "default",
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

And finally we assign the role (`editor` access to the folder):

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/$permit_project/$permit_env/role_assignments \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $permit_sdk_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user": "jane@acme.com",
    "role": "editor",
    "resource_instance": "folder:finance"
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.api.role_assignments.assign(
    {
        "user": "jane@acme.com",
        "role": "editor",
        "resource_instance": "folder:finance",
    }
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.api.roleAssignments.assign({
  user: "jane@acme.com",
  role: "editor",
  resource_instance: "folder:finance",
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Folder permissions propagate to child files and folders

Note that while Jane can now `list-files`, `create-file` and `rename` the folder, she can't actually access files within the folder. In fact, there are no files in the folder yet. Let's fix that.

#### Creating a relationship tuple

First, we'll create a `parent` relationship from the `2023_report` file to the `finance` folder:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/$permit_project/$permit_env/relationship_tuples \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $permit_sdk_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subject": "folder:finance",
    "relation": "parent",
    "object": "file:2023_report"
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.api.relationship_tuples.create(
    {
        "subject": "folder:finance",
        "relation": "parent",
        "object": "file:2023_report",
    }
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.api.relationshipTuples.create({
  subject: "folder:finance",
  relation: "parent",
  object: "file:2023_report",
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Relationship tuples vs. Role assignments
Role assignments and relationship tuples are quite similar:

- Role assignments create a role relationship between a user and a resource instance.
- Relationship tuples create a relationship between two resource instances.

The truth is, role assignments are actually a special type of relationship tuples (where the subject is a user and the relation is a role).
:::

#### Creating a role derivation

Next, we'll change our graph schema slightly and add a **role derivation**.

A role derivation is a rule that specifies that a role on one resource instance **automatically means** another role on a **related** resource instance.

More strictly:

```
If a user has role `A` on a folder `X`, it implies that the same user
should be automatically granted a role `B` on all files where
the file `parent` is the `X` folder.
```

In our case, we want anyone who has the `editor` role on a folder, to automatically get the `editor` role on any file contained within that folder, that is, any file that has a `parent` relationship with that folder.
Let's define that:

#### folder#editor -> file#editor (via `parent`)

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/$permit_project/$permit_env/resources/file/roles/editor \
  -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $permit_sdk_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "granted_to": {
        "users_with_role": [
            {
                "linked_by_relation": "parent",
                "on_resource": "folder",
                "role": "editor"
            }
        ]
	}
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.api.resource_roles.update(
    "file",
    "editor",
    {
        "granted_to": {
            "users_with_role": [
                {
                    "linked_by_relation": "parent",
                    "on_resource": "folder",
                    "role": "editor",
                },
            ],
        },
    }
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.api.resourceRoles.update("file", "editor", {
  granted_to: {
    users_with_role: [
      {
        linked_by_relation: "parent",
        on_resource: "folder",
        role: "editor",
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that the url endpoint modifies the granted role (`file#editor`) and specifies that it's granted to users with the `folder#editor` role on linked `parent` folders.

We'll do the same to also propagate the other roles from folder to file.

#### folder#commenter -> file#commenter (via `parent`)

<Tabs groupId="language">

        on_resource: "folder",
        role: "viewer",
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that now finally the `folder#commenter` role is finally different (granting different permissions) from `folder#viewer`, because they derive different roles on `file`.

### 4. Account admin permissions

We wish that if a user is granted admin access on the entire account, it will grant the highest permission level on all folders and files within the account.

We need to first define an account (called `acme`) that will be related to our files and folders.

#### account:acme

#### Role derivations

Since role derivations propagate recursively, associating a folder with an account will grant permissions not only on that folder, but also on the files it contains.

Let's grant anyone who has the `account#admin` role the `folder#editor` role on any folder in that account:

                    "on_resource": "account",
                    "role": "admin",
                },
                {

            ]
        }
    }
)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's grant anyone who has the `account#admin` role the `file#editor` role on any file in that account (note that since we're PATCHing the editor role, we also specify the existing relation):

### 5. General access to "Everyone in account"

The last thing we're missing is the ability to give anyone in an account the editor role on a specific file. To do that, we'll add another relation from files to accounts called `account_global`, and create a role derivation giving any member of the account the editor role on these files.

First, we'll create the new relation:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/$permit_project/$permit_env/resources/file/relations \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $permit_sdk_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key": "account_global",
    "name": "Account Global",
    "subject_resource": "account"
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.api.resource_relations.create(
    "file",
    {
        "key": "account_global",
        "name": "Account Global",
        "subject_resource": "account",
    }
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.api.resourceRelations.create("file", {
  key: "account_global",
  name: "Account Global",
  subject_resource: "account",
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then let's add the derived role (note that since we're PATCHing the editor role, we also specify the existing relations):

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/$permit_project/$permit_env/resources/file/roles/editor \

  -d '{
    "granted_to": {
        "users_with_role": [
            {
                "linked_by_relation": "account_global",
                "on_resource": "account",
                "role": "member"
            }
            {
                "linked_by_relation": "account",
                "on_resource": "account",
                "role": "admin",
            },
            {
                "linked_by_relation": "parent",
                "on_resource": "folder",
                "role": "editor"
            },
        ]
	}
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.api.resource_roles.update(
    "file",
    "editor",
    {
        "granted_to": {

                {

    }
)
```

        on_resource: "account",
        role: "member",
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Checking permissions

Now that we've configured everything and pushed some data, let's do a few permission checks to see what permissions Jane and John have.

First, we'll launch a Policy Decision Point (PDP). The PDP is a small container that fetches policy and data from Permit's cloud service and has all it needs to make decisions locally.

<Tabs groupId="region">
  <TabItem value="uswest" label="US West">

```bash
docker run -it \
    -e PDP_API_KEY=$permit_sdk_api_key \
    -e PDP_CONTROL_PLANE=https://api.permit.io \
    -p 7766:7000 \
    -p 8081:8081 \
    permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="useast" label="US East">

```bash
docker run -it \
    -e PDP_API_KEY=$permit_sdk_api_key \
    -p 7766:7000 \
    -p 8081:8081 \
    permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That second port (8081) is optional. You can use it if you want to interact directly with the OPA instance running within the PDP.

Let's first see if John can read the 2023_report file:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl http://localhost:7766/allowed \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $permit_sdk_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "user": {
            "key": "john@acme.com"
        },
        "resource": {
            "tenant": "default",
            "type": "file",
            "key": "2023_report"
        },
        "action": "read"
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.check(
    # user
    "john@acme.com",
    # action
    "read",
    # resource
    {
        "type": "file",
        "key": "2023_report",
    },
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.check(
  // user
  "john@acme.com",
  // action
  "read",
  // resource
  {
    type: "file",
    key: "2023_report",
  }
);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We get back a `true` result, meaning that John can read the file. Can he update it?

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl http://localhost:7766/allowed \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $permit_sdk_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "user": {
            "key": "john@acme.com"
        },
        "resource": {
            "tenant": "default",
            "type": "file",
            "key": "2023_report"
        },
        "action": "update"

await permit.check(
    # user

    # action
    "update",
    # resource
    {
        "type": "file",
        "key": "2023_report",
    },
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.check(
  // user
  "john@acme.com",
  // action
  "update",
  // resource
  {
    type: "file",
    key: "2023_report",
  }
);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We get back a `false` result, meaning that John cannot update the file. That's because he only has `viewer` permissions on the file.

Can Jane update the file?

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl http://localhost:7766/allowed \
  -X POST \

        "user": {
            "key": "jane@acme.com"
        },
        "resource": {
            "tenant": "default",
            "type": "file",
            "key": "2023_report"
        },

```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
await permit.check(
    # user
    "jane@acme.com",
    # action
    "read",
    # resource
    {
        "type": "file",
        "key": "2023_report",
    },
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript
await permit.check(

  }
);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Yes! Jane can update the file because she has editor permissions on the finance folder, and those permissions propagate through the derived role.
