title: Implementing Access Requests & Approvals
---

In this tutorial, you will learn how to integrate an access request and approval system into your app using Permit.io. We’ll
cover how users can **[request access](/embeddable-uis/element/access-request)** to specific areas of your
application, while admins **review, [approve](/embeddable-uis/element/operation-approval) or deny** those requests effortlessly.

## What are Permit Elements?

In this tutorial, we’ll explore **[Permit Elements](/embeddable-uis/overview)** — secure, embeddable UI
components that revolutionize access management for modern applications. These components empower your users to handle **[access
requests](/embeddable-uis/element/access-request)** and approvals directly within your app, delivering a
seamless and user-friendly experience without compromising on security.

With Permit Elements, you can effortlessly integrate permission management into your app, enabling you to streamline workflows
and maintain robust control over access policies.

## Configuring your JWKS

In this section, we’ll explore **[JSON Web Key Sets](/embeddable-uis/embedding-elements#configuring-jwks-for-your-environment)** (JWKS) —
a critical component for ensuring the integrity of your JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWKS is essentially a collection of public keys
that your application uses to validate incoming tokens, confirming they are legitimate and originate from a trusted source.

By configuring JWKS in your app, you enable it to automatically fetch the public keys needed for secure token verification.
This adds an **essential layer of security** to your authentication process, ensuring that only properly authenticated users can
access your resources.

## Setting up Permit and Elements

Now that you’re familiar with the basics, it’s time to dive into integrating Permit into your app. In this section, we’ll
guide you through the essential steps, including installing dependencies, setting up the **[Policy Decision Point](/overview/glossary/#pdp)** (PDP), and
configuring your app for a seamless integration. By the end, you’ll have a **fully operational access control system**, ready to
manage permissions efficiently and securely.

## Building the Authorization Policy

This is where the real magic of **authorization** happens—deciding exactly what your users can do within your app. In this
section, we’ll guide you through **creating resources, defining roles, and specifying actions** users can take on those resources.
Once everything is set up, you’ll **assign these roles and permissions** to your users, ensuring everyone has the right level of
access for their needs.

## Configuring Elements

In this section, we’ll explore how to customize **[Permit Elements](/embeddable-uis/overview)** to fit
perfectly within your app’s design and workflows. Permit Elements are built with flexibility in mind, allowing you to tweak
both their behavior and appearance to match your app’s unique style.

We’ll walk through the key customization options step by step—covering how to adjust workflows, modify visual elements, and
ensure everything blends seamlessly with your app’s user interface. By the end, you’ll have a polished, secure, and fully
integrated solution that enhances both functionality and design.

## Embedding the Elements in our App

In this section, we’re diving into the technical side by **embedding the Permit Elements** directly into your app. First, we’ll take
the generated **[iframe](/embeddable-uis/element/access-request#creating-an-iframe)** snippet and
seamlessly integrate it into your app’s codebase.

Next, we’ll cover how to log users into the element, ensuring everything works together smoothly.

With these steps completed, you’ve successfully **installed the dependencies**, set up the **Policy Decision Point** (PDP),
and **configured [Permit](https://app.permit.io) for your app**.

You’re now ready to embed Permit Elements, giving your users the ability to handle access
requests and approvals seamlessly. With everything in place, your app is equipped for **secure, efficient access management**.
