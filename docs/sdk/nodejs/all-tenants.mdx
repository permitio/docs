# Node.js All Tenants Check Examples


### 1. Perform All Tenants Check

The all-tenants check feature allows users to verify if a specific user is permitted to perform a certain action on a resource across all tenants.
:::note
You can also find information about the All tenants check in the [Permit Authorization Redoc](http://localhost:7766/redoc#tag/Authorization-API/operation/is_allowed_all_tenants_allowed_all_tenants_post).
:::


To perform this check, send a GET request to the `/allowed/all-tenants` endpoint with the following parameters:

- **user**: The identifier of the user for whom you want to check permissions.
- **action**: The action to check permission for (e.g., read, write, delete).
- **resource**: The resource type on which the action is being performed.
- **context**: Additional context information for the permission check (optional).
- **sdk**: The identifier for the SDK making the request.

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:7766/allowed/all-tenants' \
  -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  -D '{ "user": "employee1", "action": "read", "resource": "document", "context": {}, "sdk": "node" }'
Upon successful completion, the API returns a response indicating whether the user is allowed to perform the specified action across all tenants.
```

### 2. Example Response
If the user is permitted, the response will indicate success along with a message confirming the permission:

```bash
{
  "allowed": true,
  "message": "User 'employee1' is permitted to read the document across all tenants."
}
```

If the user is not permitted, the response will indicate denial of permission.
