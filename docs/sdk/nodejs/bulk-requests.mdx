# Node.js Bulk Requests Examples

### 1. Bulk Create Relationship Tuples

The bulk request will creates multiple relationship tuples at once using the provided tuple data.       The bulk request is a POST request to the `/relationship_tuples/bulk` endpoint.
        In the data of the request, each tuple object in the operations array is of type RelationshipTupleCreate and is
essentially a tuple of (subject, relation, object, tenant).

- **subject and object** are both resource instances, formatted as `<resource_type:instance_key>` strings (e.g: Folder:budget23).
- **relation** is the name of the relation.
- **tenant** is the key of the tenant in which to place the relation (optional if at least one of subject/object already exists).

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/relationship_tuples/bulk' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'
  -D '{ "operations":[
                         {
                         "subject": "organization:permitio",
                         "relation": "owner",
                         "object": "repo:opal",
                         "tenant": "public"
                         },
                     ]
      }'
```
The return value is a list of RelationshipTuple objects, one for each tuple that was created.


### 2. Bulk Delete Relationship Tuples

Deletes multiple relationship tuples at once using the provided tuple data.
The bulk request is a DELETE request to the `/relationship_tuples/bulk` endpoint.
Each tuple object is of type RelationshipTupleDelete and is essentially a tuple of (subject, relation, object).

- **subject and object** are both resource instances, formatted as `<resource_type:instance_key>` strings (e.g: Folder:budget23).
- **relation** is the name of the relation.


```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/relationship_tuples/bulk' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'
  -D '{ "idents": [
                    {
                    "subject": "organization:permitio",
                    "relation": "owner",
                    "object": "repo:removed_repo"
                    }
                  ]
      }'
```

### 3. Possible Errors:
- **PermitApiError**: If the API returns an error HTTP status code.
- **PermitContextError**: If the configured ApiContext does not match the required endpoint context.
