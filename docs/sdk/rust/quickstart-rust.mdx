# Rust Quickstart

Rust SDK for Permit.io is coming soon!
We are planning to release the Rust SDK in the coming weeks (around January 2024) and this page will be updated with the latest information.
For now, you can use the [Permit.io REST API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc) to integrate Permit.io into your Rust application.
