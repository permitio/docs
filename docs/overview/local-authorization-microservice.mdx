Running a local **authorization microservice** ([PDP](/overview/glossary#pdp)) provides significant benefits for your application's performance, security, and reliability. This guide will help you understand and set up local authorization in your application.

## Why Run Authorization Locally?

Running authorization locally through a **Policy Decision Point** (PDP) offers several key advantages:

### 1. Lightning-Fast Performance

Experience **zero network latency** with all decisions made **locally** within your infrastructure. Process **thousands of requests per second** with **sub-millisecond latency**, ensuring **every millisecond counts** for user-facing applications while **minimizing external API calls**.

### 2. Enhanced Security

Keep sensitive data **never leaving your infrastructure** while maintaining **data residency requirements**. Enjoy **full control over your authorization layer** with **encrypted communication** between your application and the local PDP.

### 3. Improved Reliability

Maintain **business continuity** with a system that works even if cloud services are down. Operate independently for **critical decisions** with **full control over your authorization infrastructure** and built-in **failover capabilities**.

### 4. Advanced Policy Support

Support all policy types including **[RBAC](/how-to/build-policies/rbac/overview)**, **[ABAC](/how-to/build-policies/abac/overview)**, and **[ReBAC](/how-to/build-policies/rebac/overview)**. Handle **sophisticated authorization scenarios** with **instantly reflected** policy changes and **flexible configuration** options.

# Running the Authorization Microservice

<TimelineStep>

## Pull the Docker Container

First, pull the latest **PDP container** from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

<Video src={pullPDP} controls />

:::note
If you haven't installed Docker yet, [get it here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).
:::

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

## Run the Container

Launch the PDP container with your [API key](/overview/use-the-permit-api-and-sdk):

```bash
docker run -it -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_DEBUG=True \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

<Video src={runPDP} controls />

<br />

The container will expose the PDP on `localhost:7766`, ready to handle authorization requests.

:::tip
You can verify the container is running and check its status with:

```bash
docker ps
docker logs <container_id>
```

:::

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed **logging** for troubleshooting:

```bash
docker run -it -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_DEBUG=True \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  --env PDP_OPA_DECISION_LOG_CONSOLE=True \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

This configuration provides:

**Detailed Decision Logs**: Comprehensive logging of all authorization decisions and their outcomes.

**Performance Metrics**: Real-time monitoring of system performance and resource usage.

**Error Tracking**: Detailed information about any errors or issues that occur.

**Policy Evaluation Details**: In-depth information about how policies are being evaluated.

### Custom Port Configuration

Change the default ports to match your infrastructure:

```bash
docker run -it -p 7766:7000 -p 8181:8181 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

The container exposes two ports:

- `7766`: The main PDP API port
- `8181`: The OPA API port for direct policy queries

:::tip
You can interact directly with the OPA API on port 8181 for advanced policy queries and debugging.
:::

### Decision Log Settings

Fine-tune logging behavior for your needs:

```bash
docker run -it -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  --env PDP_OPA_DECISION_LOG_ENABLED=True \
  --env PDP_OPA_DECISION_LOG_MIN_DELAY=1 \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

<TimelineWrapper>
<TimelineStep>

### Health Checks

Monitor your PDP's **health status** through the health endpoint:

```
http://localhost:7766/health
```

Get real-time information about your **container status**, **policy sync status**, and **connection health** while tracking **resource utilization** metrics to optimize performance.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### Metrics

Access detailed **performance metrics** through the metrics endpoint:

```
http://localhost:7766/metrics
```

Monitor **request latency** and **decision counts** while analyzing **cache hit rates** and **error rates** to identify and resolve performance issues.

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

### API Documentation

View the complete PDP API documentation through the ReDoc interface:

```
http://localhost:7766/redoc
```

Browse all **available endpoints** with their **request/response formats**, learn about **authentication methods**, and review comprehensive **error handling** procedures.

## What did you learn?

From this walkthrough, you've learned:

- How to set up and run a local **authorization microservice**
- Configure advanced **PDP options** for your specific needs
- Monitor and debug your **authorization layer**
- Access detailed **metrics** and health information

:::tip FUN FACT!
A well-configured local PDP can handle **thousands** of authorization decisions per second with **sub-millisecond latency**, making it perfect for high-performance applications. Some of our customers process **millions** of decisions daily with a single PDP instance!
