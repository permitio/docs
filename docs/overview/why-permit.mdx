Every application out there needs an authorization layer - but that doesn’t mean you need to build it from scratch.
That’s what Permit here is for!

## Why use Permit.io?

[Authorization](/overview/glossary#authorization) is a complex challenge every developer building an application has to face.
It plays the crucial role of ensuring that the **right people** and services have the **right access** to the **right resources**.

Authorization is more than just how your software enforces access. It's about connecting systems and people to what you’ve built.
It's the **experiences** the developers and their end users go through to manage your product on a daily basis.
That’s why Permit doesn’t provide you with just the building blocks of creating your own authorization layer - but with the whole package:

### Infrastructure

Permit allows you to **[decouple your authorization policy and application code](/overview/how-does-it-work#decoupling-policy-and-code)**,
providing you with everything you need to create the perfect authorization layer for your application -
A centralized control panel, SDKs, APIs, and [microservice for authorization](/overview/how-does-it-work#the-policy-decision-point-pdp).
These allow you to easily set up decision and enforcement points within your application.

### Backoffice

Permit’s cloud service provides you with a full set of no-code tools that allow you, as well as every relevant person
in your organization (e.g., product, security, support, or sales) to manage authorization within your application in a
secure way, with zero coding knowledge required.

### Interfaces

Permit provides you with a full set of pre-built UI components that provide fully functional access control,
allowing you to safely delegate them to your end users.

The combination of these three components makes Permit a full end-to-end solution that covers all of your access control needs -
so you **never have to build permissions again**.
