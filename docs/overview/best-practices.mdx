Permit is a full-stack authorization-as-a-service solution that allows you to implement secure, granular, and easy-to-use permission management. Before you get into implementing, here are some guidelines we recommend you follow for smooth integration of Permit into your software development lifecycle. This isn't a must, but these can certainly streamline your work.

## Project Scope

- Before we start integrating anything, it’s helpful to get a clear understanding of our use case and user story. This way, we will be able to gauge the priorities, scale, and data volume our authorization layer will need to handle.
- It can be very useful to determine the appropriate policy authoring interfaces required by the different stakeholders in your project (Developers, product managers, security personnel, and end-users).

## Modeling your Policies

Once you've established the basic concept of what your authorization layer needs to do and who should have access to operating it, take a look at the authorization policies themselves:

- Start with a policy model that best resembles your existing authorization mechanism and enhance it from there.
- If you're not sure where to start, it’s best to opt for simpler models such as [Multi-Tenant](/concepts/multitenancy/) [RBAC](/how-to/build-policies/rbac/overview) or [ReBAC](/how-to/build-policies/rebac/overview) with a simple hierarchy/direct [ownership](/how-to/ownership).

## Aim for a Quick POC

- Once you pick the model you would like to implement, it could be useful to **select a specific segment of your application** to apply Permit. This allows for detailed and fine-grained enforcement without overwhelming your existing setup.
- If you have an in-house solution in place, consider running Permit **alongside your current authorization system** for added confidence. This can include operating Permit in a read-only mode to assess its operation without making immediate changes.
- A PoC with Permit can be set up really quickly - implementing it into a small side project **shouldn’t take more than a few minutes** and range from **a few hours** in a development or staging environment to approximately **two weeks for a full deployment** in a small to medium-sized application segment.

## Deployment and Silos

### Consider Projects and Environments

- [Projects](/manage-your-account/projects-and-env#projects) and [Environments](/manage-your-account/projects-and-env#environments) within Permit can help you **silo your deployments effectively**.

Each application or major service should correspond to a Permit **Project**, with deployments (Development, Staging, UAT, Production) matched to specific Permit **Environments**

### Tenants

- Leverage [Tenants](/concepts/multitenancy/#tenants-in-permitio) to isolate users and **resources that should only work together**. This feature facilitates application-level multi-tenancy.

### Policy Decision Points (PDPs)

- [PDPs](/overview/how-does-it-work#the-policy-decision-point-pdp), the network nodes responsible for answering authorization queries using policies and contextual data, are usually initially deployed as sidecars or within load-balanced containers using services like Fargate, Cloud Run, or Kubernetes (e.g., EKS).
- It’s important to ensure each PDP is correctly siloed to its intended environment using its [unique secret key](/manage-your-account/workspace-settings#api-keys).

## Managing Policy SDLC and CI/CD

### SDLC

- You can implement [environment-specific access control](/manage-your-account/workspace-settings#member-management) to manage **who can make policy changes** across different stages of deployment. For instance, a product manager may alter policies in the staging environment but would need a developer or DevOps to apply those changes to production.

### CI/CD Integration

- The `[create-env](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Environments/operation/create_environment)` API can be utilized to dynamically **preview environments for deployment** as part of your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring controlled access during the review process (For example, giving access only to the developer who created the pull-request).
- The `[copy-env](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Environments/operation/copy_environment)` API can be used to merge/promote changes between environments, maintaining consistency and efficiency.
- Consider using the [Permit Terraform provider](/integrations/infra-as-code/terraform-provider/) to manage environment baselines and policy changes systematically.
- [Integration with Git](/integrations/gitops/overview) allows merging and enforcing policy changes by managing authorization policies just as you would manage code.

## The Right Interfaces for the Right People

- [Policy editor access](/manage-your-account/workspace-settings#member-management) can be allocated to stakeholders based on their role and technical proficiency. This ensures that non-technical staff and developers with limited requirements can make necessary adjustments without complications.
- Permit API and Terraform provider access can be granted to the broader developer team, facilitating standard operational tasks.
- GitOps and direct policy-as-code access should usually be restricted for highly skilled developers, typically a small subset within any organization.
- [Permit’s embeddable UI components](/embeddable-uis/overview) can be used to delegate access control functionality to your end users safely.

## Never Hesitate to Reach Out
