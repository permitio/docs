## What is OPToggles?

Optoggles is an Open Source project that was built to take the pain from building and maintaining feature flags.

For frontened developers, there's no change in their experience from another feature flag solution.<br/>
For backend developers, there's little amount of work and the feature flags are automatically created and kept up-to-date in real time.

Optoggles is built on top of OPA and OPAL:

It uses OPA as the source of truth for what features users authorized to see.
It uses OPAL to get real-time policy/data updates.

OPToggles is working with [launchdarkly.com](https://www.launchdarkly.com) and with a Generic REST API

### Fullstack-Authorization

At Permit.io, we believe that authorization isn't just about how your software enforces access. 
It is also about the experiences the dev teams and their users have with the software. 
For the best experiences, we provide a suite of tools:

1. Infrastructure - A centralized control panel, SDKs, APIs, and microservices you need to add to create a decision and enforcement points.

2. Backoffice - A set of (no-)code tools that the rest of the team (e.g., product, security, support, sales) needs to support the product. We empower developers so they can easily empower the rest of their team.

3. Interfaces - A complete UI solution for your end-users.

When combining all three layers, you get Permit.io. Permit.io delivers an end-to-end solution, covering all access-control needs so that you won't have to build anything.
