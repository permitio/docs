Learn how to leverage the Permit **API** and **SDK** to integrate robust access control into your application. This guide will walk you
through the essential steps, from setting up your environment to managing user permissions seamlessly.

## Our API & SDK Reference

Explore the [complete API documentation](https://api.permit.io/scalar) to dive into all available endpoints and their usage.

## Obtain your API key

To start using Permit.io, you’ll need an API key to authenticate your application with the Permit platform. This key is
essential for accessing Permit’s authorization services and managing your app's permissions.

1. Open the [Permit Dashboard](https://app.permit.io/) and go to the **Projects** screen.
2. Select the desired [Project](/overview/glossary#projects) and [Environment](/overview/glossary#environment).
3. On the environment card, click the ![three dots icon](/ui-videos/getting-started/connecting-your-app/dots.png) in the
   top-right corner.
4. Choose **Copy API Key** from the dropdown menu.

:::tip TOP TIP
You can also copy the Environment API Key of the active environment by clicking on the **User Menu Icon > Copy Environment
Key**

:::info Remember
The API Key that you will copy from the user menu is linked to the active environment on the sidebar.
Switching to another active environment and then clicking on the **Copy Environment Key** option will copy a **different**
API Key - the API key of the newly activated environment.

## Installing the SDK

To get started with Permit, you need to install the Permit SDK in your project. Open your terminal and run the following command.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/install" />

## Importing the Permit SDK

The next step is to import the Permit SDK into your project. The library provides all the tools you
need to interact with Permit’s APIs, including checking user permissions.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/import" />

## Initializing the Permit object

Once the library is imported, you’ll need to initialize the Permit object. This object serves as the main interface for interacting
with Permit.

You will need your API key, which you can obtain from the Permit dashboard. We have a whole [guide](/overview/sync-your-first-user-with-sdk) for this.
This API key allows you to securely authenticate and interact with Permit’s API.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/initialize" />

:::tip
If you want the SDK to `emit logs`, add the below code to your Permit instance.

```js
log: {
  level: "debug";
}
```

If you want the SDK to throw errors if you get a `timeout` or `network error`, add the below code to your Permit instance.

```js
throwOnError: true;
```

## Perform your first call to Permit

It's time to use the API to call our first endpoint, and for this example, we will create a new role, and it's associated permissions.

> Here is code example of a `Manager` role, with the respective permissions on a `account` resource:
>
> - `read`
> - `delete`

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/first-api-sdk/first-call" />

> and the result will be:

![Manager Role](/img/updated/walkthroughs/api-and-sdk/manager-role.png)

## What did you learn?

In this guide, you’ve learned how to:

- Fetch your API key.
- Initialize a Permit Object using the `permitio` library.
- Run your first API call and thus create a new role with permissions.

:::tip FUN FACT!
Ever heard of the [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja/)? Developers created it as a joke, but it became a hit for testing API integrations while
sending random cat facts.
