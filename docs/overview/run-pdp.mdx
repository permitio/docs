title: Run the PDP (Policy Decision Point)
description: Run your PDP locally to have the Authorization engine test your permissions.
---

Permit provides you with a [Policy Decision Point](/overview/how-does-it-work#the-policy-decision-point-pdp),
which functions as your microservice for authorization. You can use either a **managed Cloud PDP** hosted by Permit.io
([see capabilities](/concepts/pdp/cloud-pdp-capabilities)),
or a **container PDP** you deploy yourself.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs groupId="pdp">

<TabItem value="container" label="Container PDP" default>

Please follow the steps below to **install** and **run** the container on your local machine.

### Pulling PDP container from Docker Hub

If you do not have Docker installed as of yet, **[click here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** to install Docker.

```
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

### Running the container

Remember to **replace** `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the **API Key** you obtained.

```
docker run -it -p 7766:7000 --env PDP_DEBUG=True --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

:::info
Congratulations! You should now have a PDP container running. You can always check the status of the container
by typing `docker ps` in your terminal.

<TabItem value="cloud" label="Cloud PDP">

It is extremely simple to utilize the Cloud PDP. As part of the initialization of the Permit instance, you need to pass
the Cloud PDP URL ([see Cloud PDP Capabilities](/concepts/pdp/cloud-pdp-capabilities)).

:::danger REMEMBER
The Cloud PDP is a **managed, production-ready** PDP hosted by Permit.io.

The Cloud PDP can be used in production for many workloads. For latency-sensitive deployments, you may still want to deploy a **container PDP** close to your application.

**ABAC is not supported** on the Cloud PDP – deploy a container PDP if you need ABAC or container-only helper APIs such as all-tenants checks or local enforcement APIs. 
For the full list of supported features, see [Cloud PDP Capabilities](/concepts/pdp/cloud-pdp-capabilities).

:::

```js
// This line initializes the SDK and connects your app
// to the Permit.io Cloud PDP.

const permit = new Permit({
  pdp: "https://cloudpdp.api.permit.io",
  // your API Key
  token: "[YOUR_API_KEY]",
});
```
