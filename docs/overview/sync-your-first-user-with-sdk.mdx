title: Sync your First User
---

Syncing users is one of the most integral parts of using Permit, as it serves as the handoff point
between your application's user management system (usually Authentication or IdP) and the Permit authorization control-plane.

:::note NOTE
**`Users`** are the **name** we use for both **human** and **machine identities**.

## TL;DR

Sync users on-the-fly by passing their unique ID to the `createUser` API or `users.create/sync` SDK call.
This should be done as part of your Authentication callback.

1. Newly added users would appear in the Directory under `All Tenants`.
2. Assign roles to users to also link them to specific tenants.
3. You can assign multiple users to multiple roles at multiple tenants.
4. You can use the bulk API to load multiple users at once.

---

## When to sync your users?

The ideal time to sync users into Permit is during **sign-in** or **sign-up**, right after **authentication verifies their identity**. At this
stage, map their organizational role (e.g., Head of Marketing, Customer, or Patient) and relevant JWT claims to application-level roles,
attributes, and relationships. This ensures their permissions align immediately with their role and streamlines access management.

## Our API Reference

In this walkthrough, we'll show you how to sync your first user into Permit using the API, ensuring they're already assigned a
role, or ready to be assigned roles and permissions within your access control model.

We will be making use of two separate endpoint in our API:

1. [Creating a user](https://api.permit.io/scalar#tag/users/POST/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/users)
2. [Assigning a role to a user](https://api.permit.io/scalar#tag/users/POST/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/users/{user_id}/roles)

## Sync Users from your identity provider

To create a user in Permit, you need to make a POST request to the users endpoint using your project ID (`proj_id`),
environment ID (`env_id`), and the user's unique details. This ensures the user is properly synced into the specified environment
and ready for role assignments.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/sync-first-user/sync-sdk-request" />

:::tip Sync Users via SCIM
Permit supports user synchronization through **SCIM** (System for Cross-domain Identity Management). This allows seamless integration with
identity providers like [Entra ID](/integrations/SCIM/EntraID), [Okta](/integrations/SCIM/OKTA), and others. SCIM simplifies user management by automatically provisioning, updating,
and de-provisioning users in Permit.

## Verify the user was created in the Permit Directory

> In this case, we will use `cURL` to run this request
> and as a result, we achieve a new user that's created in the UI, under the `Directory`.

:::tip

As part of the POST request, or in this example the `userData` object, you can directly assign roles to the user upon creation. Simply include the `role_assignments`
field in the request body, such as:

```js
role_assignments: [{ role: "manager", tenant: "default" }];
```

This allows you to streamline the user creation process by immediately associating them with the appropriate role and into the
right tenant.

:::

> Below is the request in Postman for **adding a user with a role assignment**:

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/sync-users/api-request-role-postman.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

> And therefore the result of this request in the Permit `directory`:

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/sync-users/api-request-success-2.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

## Assign a role to the User (optional)

Once the user is created, you can choose to make another API request to `assign a role to the user`. This is done by calling the
following endpoint.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/sync-first-user/assign-role" />

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

## Create a new tenant

In Permit, a tenant represents an isolated space within your application where roles, resources, and permissions are separated.
This enables **multitenancy**, allowing the same user to exist in multiple tenants with different roles (e.g., Admin in one tenant and
Manager in another), ensuring their permissions are context-specific.

> In this example, we will create a new `tenant` called `Marketing`.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/sync-first-user/create-tenant" />

> The result of this SDK call being successful, is the creation of a new tenant, which we can see below:

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/sync-users/new-tenant.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

## Add a user to a new tenant and assign them a different role

It is now time to guide you through `adding a user` to a `new tenant` and `assigning them a specific role`, ensuring their permissions
are customized for that tenant.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/sync-first-user/add-user-to-tenant" />

> The result of this SDK call being successful, is the creation of a the same user that already exists in a different,
> in our new `Marketing` tenant, but with a `Manager` role (rather than an `Employee' role) - which we can see below:

### Marketing Tenant

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/sync-users/marketing-tenant.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

### Default Tenant

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/sync-users/default-tenant.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

</TimelineStep>
</TimelineWrapper>

## Bulk user syncing

Our API also supports syncing and updating users en-masse.

- [Bulk `Create` User](https://api.permit.io/scalar#tag/bulk-operations/POST/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/bulk/users)
- [Bulk `Replace` User](https://api.permit.io/scalar#tag/bulk-operations/PUT/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/bulk/users)
- [Bulk `Assign Roles` to Users](https://api.permit.io/scalar#tag/bulk-operations/POST/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/role_assignments/bulk)
- [Bulk `Unassign Roles` to Users](https://api.permit.io/scalar#tag/bulk-operations/DELETE/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/role_assignments/bulk)
- [Bulk `Delete` User](https://api.permit.io/scalar#tag/bulk-operations/DELETE/v2/facts/{proj_id}/{env_id}/bulk/users)

## What did you learn?

In this guide, you've learned how to:

- Sync a user into Permit using the API.
- Assign roles to a user either during creation or later through a dedicated API call.
- Understand Permit's hierarchy (workspaces, projects, environments) and how it relates to API calls.

:::tip
Permit is fully API-driven, providing a seamless way to programmatically manage everything you can do via our
no-code UI.

Ever heard of the Cat Facts API? Developers created it as a joke, but it became a hit for testing API integrations while
sending random cat facts.
