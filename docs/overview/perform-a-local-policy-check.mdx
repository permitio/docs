title: Run a Local Policy Check using the PDP
timeline: true
---

A Policy Decision Point (PDP) is the component responsible for making authorization decisions based on defined policies. While the
default Cloud PDP provides a seamless, managed experience, performing a local policy check unlocks additional benefits like speed,
security, and extensibility. This guide walks you through what makes the local PDP setup unique and why it might be the right choice
for your application.

## Why Choose a Local PDP?

The Local PDP offers several advantages over the Cloud PDP, making it an attractive option for developers looking for enhanced
control, speed, and flexibility in their authorization workflows.

---

### Extensibility beyond RBAC

Unlike the Cloud PDP, which primarily supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), the Local PDP allows you to validate against multiple
policy models, including:

- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Decisions based on user attributes, resource attributes, and context.
- **Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)**: Decisions based on the relationships between entities, such as managers, colleagues,
  or organizational hierarchy.

This versatility makes the Local PDP a powerful tool for handling complex, real-world authorization scenarios.

### Speed: No Latency

Since the Local PDP runs directly on your infrastructure, all authorization checks are performed locally, eliminating network latency.
This results in lightning-fast decision-making, ensuring a seamless experience for your users, even under high load.

### Security: Data Stays on Your Side

With the Local PDP, your data never leaves your infrastructure. Permit.io only receives instructions about where your data is located,
but the actual data remains securely stored on your systems. This guarantees:

- **Data privacy**: You retain full control over sensitive information.
- **Compliance**: Easily adhere to strict data residency and protection regulations.

### Availability: Always On

The Local PDP ensures your application remains operational even if Permit.io experiences downtime. Since the policy engine runs
entirely on your side, you have full control over its availability, providing unparalleled reliability for critical systems.

## How to Perform a Local Policy Check

Running a local policy check is almost identical to using the Cloud PDP. The key difference lies in the Permit object initialization,
which connects to your locally hosted PDP instead of the cloud service.

## timeline-start

## Pull the PDP Docker Container

Permit.io provides the PDP as a ready-to-use Docker container. Start by pulling the latest version from Docker Hub:

```js
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

<video controls autoPlay loop>
  <source src={pullPDP} />
</video>

:::note
If Docker is not yet installed on your system, [click here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) to install Docker.
:::

## Run the Docker Container

Once the container is pulled, you can run the PDP locally. Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the Secret Key you obtained from Permit.io.

```js
docker run -it -p 7766:7000 --env PDP_DEBUG=True --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

<video controls autoPlay loop>
  <source src={runPDP} />
</video>

> The container will expose the PDP on `localhost:7766`, ready to handle authorization requests.

## Initialize the Permit object

After setting up the Local PDP, you can integrate it into your application to handle authorization checks. The process is almost
identical to using the Cloud PDP, with one key difference: pointing to the local PDP URL during initialization.

When initializing the Permit object in your application, point it to the locally hosted PDP:

```js
const permit = new Permit({
  token: "[YOUR_API_KEY]",
  pdp: "http://localhost:7766",
  // other configurations
});
```

## Perform the authorization check

Perform authorization checks as you normally would. The Local PDP will seamlessly handle policy validation. We will use the same
policy configuration as in our first policy check from the previous walkthrough.

> We have a policy configured for the `Admin` role.

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/basic-policy.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

> We have `Macy Smith` as our user for this policy check. She has been assigned the `Admin` role.

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/user-directory.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

> We have identified the enforcement point where we will check if Macy has the **permission** to `create` a `document`.

```js
const permitted = permit.check("user|987654321", "create", "document");
```

> Let’s test the output of our policy engine.

## What did you learn?

From this walkthrough, you’ve learned:

- **Local PDP Extends Capabilities**: It supports RBAC, ABAC, and ReBAC for handling complex policies beyond the Cloud PDP's RBAC model.
- **Faster and Secure**: Local PDP ensures near-zero latency and keeps all data within your infrastructure.
- **Resilient Authorization**: Even if Permit.io’s cloud services go down, your local PDP keeps your authorization checks operational.
- **Easy Integration**: Setting up and performing checks locally is nearly identical to using the cloud.

:::tip FUN FACT! - Modern policies, medieval roots
The concept of RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) traces back to medieval guilds, where roles like Apprentice and Master dictated
permissions.
