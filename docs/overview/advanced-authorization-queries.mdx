title: Advanced Authorization Queries
description: Learn advanced techniques for querying and filtering authorization data.
---

Authorization plays a crucial role in managing secure access to your systems, and advanced queries can make this process more
precise and powerful. In this guide, we'll explore various methods to retrieve permissions, manage authorized users,
and efficiently sync user data with Permit.

To better understand the principles of the advanced authorization queries below, let's base all these below principles on an example.

:::info
**Alice** and **Bob** are users in a blogging application. Here's how they interact with the blog posts:

| **User** | **Blog Post(s)**         | **Permissions**                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Alice    | Blog Post 1, Blog Post 2 | **Edit**, **Read** (Full permissions for her posts) |
| Bob      | Blog Post 3              | **Edit**, **Read** (Full permissions for his post)  |
| Alice    | Blog Post 3              | **Read** (View only)                                |
| Bob      | Blog Post 1, Blog Post 2 | **Read** (View only)                                |

Let's put this to practice.

:::tip **The Challenge**

**Alice** and **Bob** need to query the system to:

- Determine what permissions they have for specific blog posts.
- Retrieve blog posts they are allowed to view or edit.
- List the users who can perform actions on a given blog post.

:::

## Bulk Check

The `permit.bulkCheck` function allows validating multiple permissions in a single call, ideal for situations where Alice or
Bob needs to check permissions for multiple blog posts at once.

### Example: Alice Checks Read Permissions

Alice wants to know which blog posts she can read.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/bulk-check" />

Alice can read Blog Post 1, Blog Post 2, and Blog Post 3. The system returns this in one call, saving time and improving
efficiency.

You can read more about the bulk check [here](/how-to/enforce-permissions/bulk-check/).

## FilterObjects

Use the `permit.filterObjects` function to perform PDP-level filtering.

In this method, the data is fetched from the DB, and then use the filterObjects function, which returns a subset of the objects
passed to it based on the policy.

The `permit.filterObjects` function retrieves only the blog posts that Alice or Bob is permitted to access. This is useful when fetching all posts from the database but only displaying the ones a user is authorized to see.

### Example: Alice Filters Blog Posts

Alice wants to retrieve the blog posts she can edit.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/authz-queries/filter" />

The function returns Blog Post 1 and Blog Post 2, as Alice has edit permissions for these posts.

## Get Authorized Users

Use the `permit.authorized_users` function to retrieve a list of users authorized to perform a specific action on a resource.
This function takes an action and resource as inputs and returns the authorized users along with their role assignments that
granted access.

### Example: Retrieve Authorized Users

Bob wants to know who can read Blog Post 3.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/authz-queries/getAuthorizedUsers" />

The system responds with:

- Alice (has read permissions).
- Bob (has edit and read permissions).

You can read more about getting resource authorized users [here](/how-to/enforce-permissions/authorized-users).

## Get User Permissions

Use the `permit.GetUserPermissions` function to retrieve all user permissions across all registered resources and tenants.
Simply provide a "User" as input, optionally filter by a list of tenants, and receive an object detailing the permissions
and attributes for each assigned tenant.

### Example: Bob's Permissions

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/authz-queries/getUserPermissions" />

The system returns a list of Bob's permissions:

- Blog Post 1: Read
- Blog Post 2: Read
- Blog Post 3: Read, Edit

You can read more about getting user permissions [here](/how-to/enforce-permissions/user-permissions).

## What did you learn?

:::tip FUN FACT
Did you know? The concept of "authorization" dates back to ancient times when officials used wax seals on documents to verify
permission. Today, we use advanced databases and APIs, but the goal remains the sameâ€”ensuring the right people have access to
the right things.
