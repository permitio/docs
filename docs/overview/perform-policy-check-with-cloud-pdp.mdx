title: Run your First Policy Check
timeline: true
---

Performing your first **policy check** is a key step in understanding and validating the policies you've configured.
The policy decision point (PDP) lies at the heart of Permit's Authorization system, determining whether a user is authorized
to perform specific actions on a resource. This ensures that your access control model is working as intended.

## Before we start: Understanding the check function

The check function acts as a guard at the heart of your application's access control system. It evaluates whether a specific user
has the necessary permissions to **perform an action on a resource**, ensuring that only authorized users can proceed. By taking key
parameters such as the `user ID`, `action`, and `resource`, the check function queries the policy engine to return a decision.

> What exactly are the arguments passed into the `permit.check()` function?

- **`user`**: a unique string id or object that identifies the user performing the action.
- **`action`**: the action performed.
- **`resource`**: the resource (object) the action is performed on. Can be a string or an object.

> This guard mechanism is critical for enforcing your configured policies and seamlessly integrating authorization into your
> application's workflows.

:::note
The check function can accept various arguments beyond the user and resource.

## Understanding Your Policy Configuration

Let's examine the policy we'll be working with. As shown below, the `Admin` role has permissions to `create, delete, publish, and read`, but notably, it does not have permission to `update`.

</TimelineStep>

## Reviewing User Assignments

We have two users in our setup, but only one of them has the Admin role assigned. For this example, we'll focus on checking the permissions assigned to Macy Smith, who holds the Admin role.

## Setting Up the Enforcement Point

Our Permit enforcement point in the code will look like this:

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/check-function-false" />

This code snippet:

- Identifies the user making the request
- Specifies the action being attempted
- Names the resource being accessed
- Returns a boolean indicating whether the action is permitted

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

## Testing Initial Permissions

Let's run our first check with the current permissions:

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/audit-log-fail.png"
  alt="Failed permission check"
  data-zoomable
/>

As expected, the check fails because Macy doesn't have update permissions.

</TimelineStep>

## Updating Permissions

Now let's alter our permissions and give Macy the ability to `update` the `Document`.

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/permissions-true.png"
  alt="Updated permissions"
  data-zoomable
/>

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

## Testing Updated Permissions

Let's run the check again with the updated permissions:

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/check-function-true" />

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/audit-log-pass.png"
  alt="Successful permission check"
  data-zoomable
/>

Success! Macy can now perform all the actions, including updates.

:::warning
Cloud PDP is limited to RBAC policies only, with 1MB data restriction. For ABAC / ReBAC policies, you need to deploy a local PDP.

For production deployments, we recommend deploying a local PDP to minimize network latency and ensure high availability. Learn more in our [Local Authorization Microservice guide](/overview/local-authorization-microservice).

## What did you learn?

By configuring the Cloud PDP for policy checks, you've learned how to:

- Import and initialize the Permit SDK in your project
- Set up an enforcement point in your code using the check function
- Validate user permissions against your configured policies in real time
- Leverage the flexibility of the Cloud PDP to handle RBAC policy decisions seamlessly

:::tip FUN FACT!
Did you know that modern policy checks can process **thousands of decisions per second**?

Companies like Netflix use similar mechanisms to authorize every single request in their systemsâ€”whether it's playing a movie or accessing account settings.
