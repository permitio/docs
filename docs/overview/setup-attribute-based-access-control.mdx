title: Create an ABAC Policy
---

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is a powerful and flexible access control method that uses
attributes to determine access. These attributes can relate to users, resources environmental
conditions. ABAC policies are particularly useful when you need fine-grained control over access
decisions based on various dynamic factors.

## Understanding the scenario

Imagine you're managing a secure company network.

> To protect intellectual property, you want to ensure that **only employees in the R&D department** who have **completed mandatory
> cybersecurity training** can **access high-priority classified project documents**.

This level of control goes beyond traditional
roles and uses ABAC to enforce fine-grained policies based on user and resource attributes.

In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk through creating and implementing an ABAC policy for this
scenario, demonstrating the power and flexibility of attribute-based control.

## Create User Attributes

User attributes form the foundation of ABAC policies. These attributes define who the user is and
what conditions must be met for access.

- `Department`: Which department the user belongs to.
- `Training Status`: Whether the user has completed cybersecurity training.

Most user attribute values are automatically provided by your authentication provider, such as an
identity management system (e.g., Okta, Auth0, Clerk etc.). These systems store and supply user
details like department, role, or certification status during the authentication process.

- **Attribute 1**: `department` (e.g., "R&D", "Sales").
- **Attribute 2**: `training_status` (e.g., "completed", "pending").

In order to set User attributes navigate to **`Directory` > `Settings` >
`User Attributes` and then `Add Attribute`**.

## Create Resource Attributes

Resource attributes define the characteristics of the resources you want to control access to.
In our example, the resources are classified project documents, and the attributes will help
determine their priority and type. Additionally, we will specify the actions users can perform on
these resources.

- `Priority Level`: Classifies documents as "high", "medium", or "low" priority.
- `Document Type`: Specifies the document category (e.g., "classified", "public").

Navigate to the Resources Panel, select Resource Attributes, and add these:

- **Attribute 1**: `priority_level` (e.g., "high", "medium").
- **Attribute 2**: `document_type` (e.g., "classified").

In order to set Resource attributes navigate to **`Policy`** > **`Edit Resource`** (if one exists) > **`ABAC Options`** and then
**`Attributes`**.

## Define a Dynamic Role (User Set)

Dynamic role are collections of users grouped by specific attributes, allowing you to apply policies efficiently. For this example:

> Create a User Set that includes employees from the R&D Department who have completed cybersecurity training.

Navigate to User Sets and configure the conditions:

- `department` equals `Engineering`.
- `training_status` equals `certified`.

## Define a Dynamic Resource (Resource Set)

Dynamic resource group resources based on their attributes, enabling precise control over access. For this scenario:

> Define a Dynamic Resource for high-priority classified documents.

Navigate to Dynamic Resource and configure the conditions:

- `priority_level` equals `high`.
- `document_type` equals `classified`.

</TimelineStep>

## Create your policy rules

Policy rules link user sets, resource sets, and actions to enforce access control.

> Define an **Engineering** user as someone permitted to `read` standard `documents` but restricted from accessing highly
> classified documents. In contrast, an **R&D Certified Employee** is allowed to `read` both standard `documents` and `High Priority 
Classified Documents`.

## What did you learn?

In this guide, you've learned how to create and implement an Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
policy step by step.

By leveraging ABAC, you've seen how to move beyond rigid roles and permissions to a dynamic system
that responds to the nuances of user and resource characteristics.

:::tip FUN FACT!
Did you know that ABAC is sometimes referred to as policy-based access control? This is because
ABAC doesn't rely on static roles but instead evaluates dynamic policies in real-time. For example,
it can allow a temporary contractor working remotely during a snowstorm to access certain
resources—if the conditions (like their role, location, and task type) align perfectly with the
policy. This adaptability makes ABAC a popular choice for modern, cloud-based systems
