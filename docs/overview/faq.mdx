# Frequently Asked Questions | OPToggles

**What is OPToggles?**

Optoggles is an Open Source project that was built to take the pain from building and maintaining feature flags.

For frontened developers, there's no change in their experience from another feature flag solution.<br/>
For backend developers, there's little amount of work and the feature flags are automatically created and kept up-to-date in real time.

## Do I need OPA + OPAL for OPTpggles?

The short answer is yes. 

Optoggles is built on top of OPA and OPAL:

- It uses OPA as the source of truth for what features users authorized to see.
- It uses OPAL to get real-time policy/data updates.

OPToggles can also work with other policy agents, please join our [slack](https://bit.ly/optoggles-slack) or contact us at [support@permit.io](mailto:support@permit.io) to learn more about these use cases.

**What targets are supported by OPToggles?**

**What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?**  
While closely related, authorization and authentication are different. 

To simplify with a metaphor - imagine a person is about to enter your home:

Authentication will deal with identifying who is at the door and deciding whether they may enter or not.

The authorization will start immediately as soon as the person is in your house. It will deal with the person's permission once they enter - can the person open the fridge? May they sleep in your bed? Can the person read your diary?

To conclude

- Authentication (AuthN) - Who is the user
- Authorization (AuthZ) - What is the user allowed to do

**Is OPToggles free?**  
Of course! OPToggles is free, forever.

**What's the difference between OPA and OPAL and Permit.io?**  

OPA, or Open Policy Agent is a generic policy based decision engine, and OPAL, or Open Policy Administration Layer is a realtime solution to keep the policy agents updated with the policies and data, in an event-driven distributed fashion. 

Permit.io is a full-stack authorization solution - covering all the layers required for building access-control for products and services - Infrastructure (e.g., Policy-engines, SDKS, APIs), Backoffice (the controls the team behind the product needs), and end-user interfaces (e.g. user management, audit logs, api-keys, ...). 
A key part of Permit.ioâ€™s infrastructure is the open-source combo of OPA and OPAL.
