# FoAz - An Emerging Internet Standard

## Introduction

**Frontend-only Authorization (FoAz)** is currently an Internet-Draft, aiming to establish an Internet standards track
protocol for the global community. Internet-Drafts are dynamic documents under the umbrella of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF), constantly updated and improved based on community input and discussion. This
ongoing initiative also invites groups outside the IETF to distribute and contribute to these working documents
as Internet-Drafts.

## Working Group

FoAz, as an emerging internet standard, is under the collective development of a working group. This group comprises
an alliance of developers from multiple companies worldwide, originating from the innovative efforts at Permit Inc.

This working group is open to any and all interested parties looking to contribute to the development of the FoAz
standard. We encourage the sharing of ideas, feedback, and suggestions, which can greatly influence the progression
and refinement of FoAz.

## Join the Working Group

To ensure the continual evolution and improvement of FoAz, we highly value community involvement. If you are
interested in contributing to the FoAz standard, here are some ways to get involved:

- **Join the conversation**: We have a dedicated [Slack workspace](https://bit.ly/permit-slack) for our working group where you can engage in
  meaningful discussions, ask questions, and share your expertise with others.

- **Provide RFC feedback**: Direct your comments and suggestions on the RFC to our [Git repository](https://github.com/permitio/foaz-site/). Pull requests
  are welcome and appreciated - they provide a great way to propose changes, improvements, or corrections to the draft.

Your contributions to the FoAz standard can help shape the future of frontend authorization, enhancing the security and ease-of-use for developers worldwide. Join us as we strive to make FoAz a robust and reliable standard for the Internet community.
